[
THE PLAN:

In a loop:
Look at a placed tile. Look at directions that are available. Choose a direction at random. For that direction:
Check if it is the last one of its type. If it is, raise a flag that prevents using closing pieces unless they are the only ones left.
Look at all tiles that perfectly could fit there and choose one.
If unable, look at all tiles that could fit there and choose one.
If unable, flag that direction as dead.
If down to just closing pieces, reset these flags (it might have only been impossible due to that limitation)
If certain "mandatory" tiles are not placed, reshuffle and start again.
