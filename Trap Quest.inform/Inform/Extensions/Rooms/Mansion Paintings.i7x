	allocate 5 seconds;
	if the noun is dress-painting and there is a worn unremovable dress, say "You try, but when your [random worn unremovable dress] tries to cross the threshold, you are pushed away by an invisible force!" instead;
	if the noun is heist-painting:
		repeat with C running through worn usually unautoremovable clothing:
			unless C is headgear or C is nudism-enabling, say "You try, but when your [C] tries to cross the threshold, you are pushed away by your headgear! It's like it's saying that it would be a mistake to enter this region with clothing that you can't easily remove..." instead;
	let LM be the list of monsters in the location of the player;
	compute painting entrance of the noun;
	now the noun is not rippling;
	repeat with M running through LM:
		deinterest M;
		compute mandatory room leaving of M;
	do nothing instead.

To compute painting entrance of (P - a painting):
	say "BUG - nothing coded for this painting.".

A painting-room is a kind of room. A painting-room has a labyrinth shape called shape. The grid position of a painting-room is usually <0,0,0>. A painting-room is usually discovered.
Definition: a painting-room is partial squirt: decide yes. [involuntary enema expulsion is 6 units at a time, rather than all of it]

Check going north:
	let P be a random painting in the location of the player;
	if P is painting:
		say "Step into [NameDesc of P]?";
		if the player is consenting, try entering P instead.

Report going south:
	let P be a random painting in the location of the player;
	if P is painting:
		compute painting completion of P;
		update player region.

To compute painting completion of (P - a painting):
	compute unique painting completion of P;
	repeat with R running through painting-rooms:
		unless R is a heist-painting-room:
			repeat with T running through things in R:
				if T is bowsette:
					try bowsette going south;
					now bowsette is moved;
				otherwise:
					only destroy T;
	if the number of on-stage rippling paintings is 0 and bowsette is off-stage and bowsette is not permanently banished, now bowsette-painting is rippling.

To compute unique painting completion of (P - a painting):
	do nothing.
