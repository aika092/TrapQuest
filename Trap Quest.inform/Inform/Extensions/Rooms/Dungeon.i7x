Dungeon01 is a sandy labyrinth room. The printed name of Dungeon01 is "Small Stone Room". "After moving through so many open areas, it was odd to come across a room so cramped. It appeared to have been built into one of the larger walls as some kind of storage cubby that gave way to another door to another area.

Boxes, chests, and crates line the walls and are stacked haphazardly all the way up to the ceiling. Moving through the room has to be done with care, as it seems like one wrong move or one bad push against one of the towers would send the whole thing tumbling down.

The bed in it appears to simply be two of the lower bunks pushed together with a larger mattress placed over them, but the royal banner hanging over the bed shows that whoever sleeps there is of some kind of authority. You dare not rest in this bed, it is clearly not for you. There are a few sparse bookcases and a desk with a lamp attached to it. Against the back wall is a single ominous looking lever with a label attached to it, but to what it does you do not know.[if saved-flat-intelligence > 14 and diaper quest is 0][one of][line break]Examining the handle reveals a leather engraving of some kind of mythological beast.

Dungeon15 is a sandy labyrinth room. The printed name of Dungeon15 is "Swimming Pool". "A large ditch occupies the centre of the room, which is surrounded by a rusted metal fence on all sides. You can't be sure whether not it was used as a swimming pool, or as some sort of underground aquarium.
