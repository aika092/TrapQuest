To Scramble Woods:
	let E be the easting part of the grid position of Stairwell01;
	let N be the northing part of the grid position of Stairwell01;
	let the sum be the spatial coordinate with maze level part 2 easting part E northing part N;[Maze level part 2 corresponds to the L part of a room's shape. Woods rooms have the shape L2.]
	now the grid position of Woods01 is the sum; [this changes the grid position of Woods01 from <0,0,0> to <2,0,0>]
	now target-floor is Woods01;[this is an example of a room that satisfies the condition "in the woods". Any will work.]
	solve the puzzle;
	make all jungle exits lead to Solid Rock.
