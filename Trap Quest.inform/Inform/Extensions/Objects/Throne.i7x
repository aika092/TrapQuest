The throne is in Dungeon11. The printed name of throne is "[TQlink of item described]throne[TQxlink of item described][shortcut-desc][verb-desc of item described]". The throne is a trap. The throne is not portable. The throne is not triggered. The throne is untriggered. The throne is revealed. Understand "bind", "binds", "tentacle", "tentacles" as the throne. The throne has a number called charge. The charge of the throne is usually 0. The throne has a number called turns. The throne can be untransformed or transformed. The throne is untransformed. The throne has a number called timesSat. The text-shortcut of throne is "thr".

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - throne):
	if C is penetrating asshole:
		if C is untriggered:
			if the largeness of belly > 5, decide on figure of throne cutscene 2;
			otherwise decide on figure of throne cutscene 1;
		otherwise if the largeness of belly > 7:
			 decide on figure of throne cutscene 4;
		otherwise if the largeness of belly > 5:
			 decide on figure of throne cutscene 3;
		otherwise:
			 decide on figure of throne cutscene 1;
	if C is untransformed, decide on figure of throne;
	decide on figure of potty throne.

To say ExamineDesc of (C - throne):
	if the noun is untransformed, say "A pink and gold throne clearly fit for a royal lady. Pink frills at the bottom obscure what could be underneath the throne.";
	otherwise say "A pink plastic chair cheaply fashioned into a princess theme through a crown decal on the backrest. A hole in the middle of the seat contains a training potty.".

To say EnvironmentDesc of (T - throne):
	say "A pink [throne] is sitting proudly at the west end of the room. ".

To say ShortDesc of (T - throne):
	say "throne".
