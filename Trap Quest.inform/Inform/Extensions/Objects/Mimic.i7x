Mimic by Objects begins here.

memic is a container. memic is openable. memic is closed. memic is not portable. The printed name of memic is "[if the mimic-disguise of memic is memic][TQlink of item described]mimic[shortcut-desc][TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described][otherwise][mimic-disguise of memic][end if]". memic is in Holding Pen. A memic has a number called mimic-boredom. memic is not trappable. A memic has a text called the mimicName. Understand the mimicName property as describing memic. Understand "mimic" as memic. [The memic is purposefully named 'memic' to throw people off. However, that's kind of a legacy feature, since the advent of the character window.]

To decide which text is the next-text-shortcut of (M - memic):
	unless the mimic-disguise of M is memic, decide on the text-shortcut of the mimic-disguise of M;
	decide on "mim".

Figure of mimic is the file "Env/Mansion/mimic1.jpg".

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (M - memic):
	unless the mimic-disguise of M is memic, decide on the examine-image of the mimic-disguise of M;
	decide on figure of mimic.

memic has a thing called mimic-disguise. The mimic-disguise of memic is usually memic.
