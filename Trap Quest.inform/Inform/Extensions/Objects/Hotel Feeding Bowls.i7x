Carry out BowlFeeding:
	allocate 6 seconds; [Selkie: does the "run paragraph on" have *any* effect here?  Aika: the "the player is not able to use their hands" uses a rulebook. Using a rulebook causes the game to assume you've probably finished saying what you've saying, and force new text to appear on a new line. This was an attempt to prevent that line break. If I remember correctly though, it didn't work and there's currently still an annoying line break.]
