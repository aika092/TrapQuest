Summoning Portals by Objects begins here.

A summoning portal is a kind of thing. A summoning portal is not portable.[ The printed name of summoning portal is "summoning portal".] The text-shortcut of summoning portal is "spo". A summoning portal can be active. A summoning portal is usually not active. A summoning portal has a number called charge. The charge of a summoning portal is usually 450. [represents the time until it spawns the next monster]A summoning portal has a number called next-summon. The next-summon of a summoning portal is usually 0.[represents the next monster it will summon we can obfuscate this from the player or show them if we want to.] Understand "mirror", "portal" as summoning portal.

A summoning portal has a number called spawn-count. The spawn-count of a summoning portal is usually 0.
A summoning portal has a number called reset-count. The reset-count of a summoning portal is usually 0.

[!<ChargeUpPortalByNumber>+

Increases the charge of a summoning portal by a given amount. If the portal already has a high charge, X will be decreased partially. Additionally, it will be decreased based on how many times it has been reset since the last time it summoned anything. Increases the portals counter for the number of times its charge has been increased since the last time it summoned a monster.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal to be charged
@param <Integer>:<X> The amount by which the portal is to be charged, which has diminishing returns by default

+!]
To ChargeUp (S - a summoning portal) by (X - a number):
	decrease X by the reset-count of S * 10;
	if the charge of S > 500:
		decrease X by X / 2;
	otherwise if the charge of S > 400:
		decrease X by X / 3;
	otherwise if the charge of S > 300:
		decrease X by X / 4;
	increase the charge of S by X;
	increase the reset-count of S by 1;
	if S is active and the charge of S > the active threshold of S:
		now S is not active;
		if S is regionally in playerRegion, say "The energy surrounding the [S] has dissipated, for now.".

[!<ChargeDownPortalByNumber>+

Decreases the charge of a summoning portal by a given amount

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal to be discharged
@param <Integer>:<X> The amount of charge the portal will lose

+!]
To ChargeDown (S - a summoning portal)  by (X - a number):
	decrease the charge of S by X.
To ChargeDown (S - summoning-circle)  by (X - a number):
	if the number of alive royal guards is 0, increase X by X * (1 + the number of held stolen clothing);
	decrease the charge of S by X.

Appeasing it with is an action applying to two things.

Check appeasing something with:
	if the second noun is not summoning portal, say "This verb is for throwing things offering things to summoning portals." instead;
	if the second noun is not mysterious-mummy:
		unless the second noun is active, say "The [second noun] doesn't even look active. Why waste your time?" instead;
	if the noun is worn and the noun is not plentiful accessory, say "You should probably take it off first." instead;
	if the second noun is summoning-circle:
		if the second noun is player, try entering the noun instead.

Report appeasing something with summoning portal:
	allocate 3 seconds.

Understand "place [something] in front of [something]" as appeasing it with.

Check inserting something into a summoning portal:
	try appeasing the noun with the second noun instead.

[!<SayPortalHintOfPortal>+

Outputs a hint on what the summoning portal "S" will spawn next.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal being examined

+!]
To say PortalHint of (S - a summoning portal):
	say "It's going to summon something soon!".

To say DivinationHint of (S - a summoning portal):
	say "You can sense that it will summon a monster soon.".

[!<SayActiveWarningOfPortal>+

Outputs a message announcing that summoning portal "S" has activated and will summon a monster soon.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal activating

+!]
To say ActiveWarning of (S - a summoning portal):
	say "[printed name of S] is now active!";

[!<DecideWhichMonsterIsTheSummonChoiceOfPortal>

Chooses which monster summoning portal "S" is about to spawn, then returns it. If it returns nothing, no monster spawns. Any logic here should probable include next-summon

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal the monster will be summoned from
@return <Monster> The monster that the summoning portal will spawn next.

+!]
To decide which object is the summonChoice of (S - a summoning portal):
	[let N be the next-summon of S;
	let M be monster1;(weak)
	if N is 1:
		now M is monster2;
	otherwise if N is 2:
		now M is monster3;
	otherwise if N is 3:
		now M is monster4;
	otherwise if N is 4:
		now M is monster5;]
	decide on nothing.

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsTheActiveThresholdOfPortal>

Chooses which monster summoning portal "S" is about to spawn, then returns it. If it returns nothing, no monster spawns.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal to be activated
@return <Integer> The charge that S must pass below in order to activate

+!]
To decide which number is the active threshold of (S - a summoning portal):
	decide on 300.

[!<ComputeSummoningCheckOfPortal>+

Represents the core of how a summoning portal functions. First decreases the charge of the portal based on game difficulty, then if the portal is activate and has a charge of 0 or less, tries to summon a monster. If it can't pick out a monster, the portal charge is increased so the portal doesn't keep checking running the choice function every turn. If the portal is inactive, but its charge is below the return value of the active threshold function, it activates.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal being checked

+!]
To compute summoning check of (S - a summoning portal) :
	decrease the charge of S by (time-seconds + game difficulty) / 2;[we always decrease the charge when before we check]
	if the charge of S < 1 and S is active:
		let M be the summonChoice of S;
		if M is monster:[since M is the result of a decide on function, "if M is monster" is pointless]
			compute S summoning M;
			compute portal reset of S;
		otherwise:
			increase the charge of S by 30;
	otherwise if S is not active and the charge of S < the active threshold of S:
		if S is regionally in playerRegion, say ActiveWarning of S;
		now S is active.
		[now the alert of the player is 1.]

[!<ComputeSummoningCheckOfPortal>+

Calls the regionally summoning function for summoning portal "S", which calls a relevant variant of summon M. Once the monster is set up, transfers the monster to the location of S and calls the monster's summoning flav function. The monster's boredom is set to 1 so the game has time to properly add it to the turn order.(or whatever causes the perception function to fire twice when monsters spawn. beats me dude.)

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal the monster is being summoned from
@param <Monster>:<M> The monster to be summoned

+!]
To compute (S - a summoning portal) summoning (M - a monster):
	compute S regionally summoning M;
	if M is nonexistant and M is on-stage, set up M;
	now M is in the location of S;
	say SummoningFlav of M;[should describe portal closing up if the player is in the room]
	if M is not interested, now the boredom of M is 1.[should fix issues where the player is in the room and the monster's perception function runs twice in a row]

[!<ComputePortalRegionallySummoningMonster>+

Should be defined uniquely for each portal. Chooses what level the monster is summoned in, and holds any code that must run depending on on level. Should also increase portal charge.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal M will be summoned from
@param <Monster>:<M> The monster to be summoned

+!]
To compute (S - summoning portal) regionally summoning (M - a monster):
	summon M;
	now the next-summon of S is a random number between 0 and 5;
	now the charge of S is the active threshold of S * 3.

[!<ComputePortalResetOfPortal>+

Sets the summoning portal "S"'s active flag to false and increases its counter for monsters spawned by 1. Starts a fresh tally of the number of times the portal has had its charge increased.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal being reset

+!]
To compute portal reset of (S - a summoning portal):
	now S is not active;
	increase the spawn-count of S by 1;
	now the reset-count of S is 0.

To compute wankingSiphon of (S - a summoning portal):
	if S is active:
		ChargeDown S by 20;
		say "[one of]You can feel energy swirling around your naughty fingers as the ambient pressure intensifies[or]Energy slowly twists and swirls around your naughty fingers[or]The ambient pressure intensifies as energy twists around your naughty fingers[cycling].[line break]".

Chapter 1 - Summoning Circle

The summoning-circle is in Dungeon33. The summoning-circle is a summoning portal. The printed name of summoning-circle is "[TQlink of item described]summoning circle[TQxlink of item described][shortcut-desc][verb-desc of item described]".
