Summoning Portals by Objects begins here.

A summoning portal is a kind of thing. A summoning portal is not portable. The text-shortcut of summoning portal is "spo". A summoning portal can be active. A summoning portal has a number called charge. The charge of a summoning portal is usually 450. [represents the time until it spawns the next monster]
A summoning portal has an object called next-summon.
Understand "mirror", "portal" as summoning portal.

A summoning portal has a number called spawn-count. The spawn-count of a summoning portal is usually 0.
A summoning portal has a number called reset-count. The reset-count of a summoning portal is usually 0.

[Number of random (non-mandatory) NPCs per region at the start of each game]
To decide which number is startingRegionalMonsterCount:
	decide on 3.

[Number of non-mandatory NPCs that the summoning portals will increase each region to over time.]
To decide which number is baseRegionalMonsterCount:
	decide on 3 + game difficulty.

To decide which number is the regionalMonsterCount of (R - a region):
	decide on baseRegionalMonsterCount.

Definition: a monster is summoningRelevant if it is undefeated. [Does it count towards the number of monsters in the region?]

Definition: a monster is regionalRelevant if it is summoningRelevant and it is regional. [Does it count towards the number of monsters in the region, and is it currently alive and undefeated in that region?]

A game universe initialisation rule:
	repeat with S running through summoning portals:
		now the next-summon of S is the summonChoice of S;
	now the next-summon of mysterious-mummy is vampiress.

[!<ChargeUpPortalByNumber>+

Increases the charge of a summoning portal by a given amount. If the portal already has a high charge, X will be decreased partially. Additionally, it will be decreased based on how many times it has been reset since the last time it summoned anything. Increases the portals counter for the number of times its charge has been increased since the last time it summoned a monster. If the charge is brought high enough when the number of monsters in the region has increased for other reasons (e.g. birth), the player can stop the portal from being active at all.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal to be charged
@param <Integer>:<X> The amount by which the portal is to be charged, which has diminishing returns by default

+!]
To ChargeUp (S - a summoning portal) by (X - a number):
	decrease X by the reset-count of S * 10;
	if the charge of S > 500:
		decrease X by X / 2;
	otherwise if the charge of S > 400:
		decrease X by X / 3;
	otherwise if the charge of S > 300:
		decrease X by X / 4;
	if X > 0:
		increase the charge of S by X;
		increase the reset-count of S by 1;
		say "The energy surrounding [NameDesc of S][if X < 60] slightly[otherwise if X >= 200] significantly[end if] weakens.";
		let R be the currentRegion of S;
		if the charge of S >= 300 and doomed < 5 and the number of regionalRelevant monsters >= the regionalMonsterCount of R:
			now S is not active;
			if S is in the location of the player:
				if S is mysterious-mummy, say "You feel a wave of relief, and the strange pressure around [NameDesc of S] dissipates as glowing motes of energy leak through the spaces in the linen. It opens its arms wide as the candles at its feet light once more.";
				otherwise say "You feel a wave of relief, and the energy around [NameDesc of S] dissipates completely, rendering it completely inactive.".

[!<ChargeDownPortalByNumber>+

Decreases the charge of a summoning portal by a given amount

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal to be discharged
@param <Integer>:<X> The amount of charge the portal will lose

+!]
To ChargeDown (S - a summoning portal) by (X - a number):
	decrease the charge of S by X.
To ChargeDown (S - summoning-circle) by (X - a number):
	if the number of alive royal guards is 0, now X is X * (1 + the number of held stolen clothing);
	decrease the charge of S by X.

Appeasing it with is an action applying to two things.

Check appeasing something with:
	if the second noun is not summoning portal, say "This verb is for offering things to summoning portals." instead;
	unless the second noun is active, say "[BigNameDesc of the second noun] doesn't even look active. Why waste your time?" instead;
	if the noun is worn and the noun is not plentiful accessory, say "You should probably take it off first." instead;
	if the second noun is summoning-circle and the noun is player, try entering the noun instead;
	if the noun is not portable, say "Good luck lifting that up." instead.

Carry out appeasing something with summoning portal:
	allocate 3 seconds.

Understand "place [something] in front of [something]" as appeasing it with.

Check inserting something into a summoning portal:
	try appeasing the noun with the second noun instead.

[!<SayPortalHintOfPortal>+

Outputs a hint on what the summoning portal "S" will spawn next.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal being examined

+!]
To say PortalHint of (S - a summoning portal):
	say "It's going to summon something soon!".

To say ActiveWarning of (S - a summoning portal):
	say "[BigNameDesc of S] is now active!";

[!<DecideWhichMonsterIsTheSummonChoiceOfPortal>

Chooses which monster summoning portal "S" is about to spawn, then returns it. If it returns nothing, no monster spawns. Any logic here should probable include next-summon

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal the monster will be summoned from
@return <Monster> The monster that the summoning portal will spawn next.

+!]
To decide which object is the summonChoice of (S - a summoning portal):
	decide on nothing.

[!<ComputeSummoningCheckOfPortal>+

Represents the core of how a summoning portal functions. If the portal is active and has a charge of 0 or less, tries to summon a monster. Portal is made active if the number of monsters in the region has dropped too low.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal being checked

+!]
To compute summoning check of (S - a summoning portal):
	if S is active:
		decrease the charge of S by time-seconds;

			let M be the next-summon of S;
			if M is off-stage monster:
				compute S summoning M;
				compute portal reset of S;
			otherwise:
				increase the charge of S by 30;
				now the next-summon of S is the summonChoice of S;
	otherwise if S is regional:
		let R be the currentRegion of S;
		if doomed is 5 or the number of regionalRelevant monsters < the regionalMonsterCount of R:
			say ActiveWarning of S;
			now S is active.

A time based rule (this is the monster summoning rule):
	if earnings < starting-earnings - 100:
		repeat with S running through loaded summoning portals:
			compute summoning check of S.

[!<ComputeSummoningCheckOfPortal>+

Calls the regionally summoning function for summoning portal "S", which calls a relevant variant of summon M. Once the monster is set up, transfers the monster to the location of S and calls the monster's summoning flav function. The monster's boredom is set to 1 so the game has time to properly add it to the turn order.(or whatever causes the perception function to fire twice when monsters spawn. beats me dude.)

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal the monster is being summoned from
@param <Monster>:<M> The monster to be summoned

+!]
To compute (S - a summoning portal) summoning (M - a monster):
	compute S regionally summoning M;

	now M is in the location of S;
	if S is regional, say SummoningFlav of M;[should describe portal closing up if the player is in the room]
	if M is not interested, now the boredom of M is 1.[should fix issues where the player is in the room and the monster's perception function runs twice in a row]

[!<ComputePortalRegionallySummoningMonster>+

Should be defined uniquely for each portal. Chooses what level the monster is summoned in, and holds any code that must run depending on on level. Should also increase portal charge.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal M will be summoned from
@param <Monster>:<M> The monster to be summoned

+!]
To compute (S - summoning portal) regionally summoning (M - a monster):
	summon M in (the currentRegion of S);
	now the next-summon of S is the summonChoice of S;
	now the charge of S is 300.

[!<ComputePortalResetOfPortal>+

Sets the summoning portal "S"'s active flag to false and increases its counter for monsters spawned by 1. Starts a fresh tally of the number of times the portal has had its charge increased.

@param <Summoning Portal>:<S> The portal being reset

+!]
To compute portal reset of (S - a summoning portal):
	let R be the currentRegion of S;
	if doomed < 5 and the regionalMonsterCount of R <= the number of regionalRelevant monsters, now S is not active;
	increase the spawn-count of S by 1;
	now the reset-count of S is 0.

To compute wankingSiphon of (S - a summoning portal):
	if S is active:
		ChargeDown S by 20;
		say "[one of]You can feel energy swirling around your naughty fingers as the ambient pressure intensifies[or]Energy slowly twists and swirls around your naughty fingers[or]The ambient pressure intensifies as energy twists around your naughty fingers[cycling].[line break]".

Chapter 1 - Summoning Circle
