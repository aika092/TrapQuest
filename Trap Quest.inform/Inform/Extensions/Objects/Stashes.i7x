Check pushing a stash:
	if the noun is unstashed, say "You already did this." instead;
	if the player is not able to manually use their hands, do nothing instead;
	if the player is prone, say "You would need to be standing in order to reach that." instead;
	if the player is immobile or the player is in danger, say "Aren't you a bit busy?" instead;
	allocate 2 seconds;
	now the noun is unstashed;
	say StashPushFlav of the noun;
	if the noun is stash-tentacled:
		compute stash tentacle of the noun;
	otherwise:
		compute stash reward of the noun;
	do nothing instead.

To say StashPushFlav of (S - a stash):
	say "You reach up and push the secret button.".

To compute stash reward of (S - a stash):

	compute autotaking AP;

To compute stash tentacle of (S - a stash):
	maybe-map-display figure of tentacle pit stash;
	now the tentacle-turns of S is 4;
	say "The floor suddenly disappears from beneath you![line break][variable custom style]A trap door?![roman type][line break]Yep, an impressively concealed trap door, which has now opened, allowing you to fall directly down... Into a pit of strong, writhing tentacles! Immediately, all four of your limbs have been grabbed, and you are completely at the tentacle pit's mercy!";
	now the stance of the player is 1;
	now S is grabbing the player;
	let C be a random worn destructible top level titfuck protection clothing;
	if the largeness of breasts > 4:

	say "[variable custom style]Oh my goooooood![roman type][line break]";

A later time based rule (this is the tentacle pit rule):
	let S be a random stash grabbing the player;
	if S is a thing:
		decrease the tentacle-turns of S by 1;
		if the tentacle-turns of S < 3: [no action beyond penetration on the first turn]

				AnnouncedSquirt semen on breasts by 10;
				AnnouncedSquirt semen on belly by 10;
				AnnouncedSquirt semen on hips by 10;
				AnnouncedSquirt semen on thighs by 10;
			if S is penetrating face:
				say "The tentacle in your mouth forcefully violates your throat![line break][variable custom style][gag sounds][roman type][line break]";
				FatigueUp 20;

			if S is penetrating vagina:
				say "The tentacle inside your [vagina] pumps away aggressively!";
				ruin vagina;
				if egg laying fetish is 1:
					say "You feel a hard lump travel up the tentacle... as an egg is implanted into your womb!";
					WombFill 1 medium eggs;
				if the tentacle-turns of S <= 0:
					say "And then with a powerful jet, you feel your pussy being pumped full to the brim with [semen]!";
					PussyFill 10;
			if S is penetrating asshole:
				say "The tentacle inside your [asshole] treats your colon like an onahole![line break][variable custom style][gag sounds][roman type][line break]";
				ruin asshole;
				if egg laying fetish is 1:
					say "You feel your sphincter widen even further as the tentacle pushes an egg up deep into your intestines!";
					AssFill 1 medium eggs;
				if the tentacle-turns of S <= 0:
					say "And then your feel your belly balloon outwards as it unleashes its own reserves of alien [semen] into your guts.";
					AssFill 10;
		if the tentacle-turns of S <= 0:
			say "The tentacles are finally done with you - [if S is penetrating an orifice]they slither out of your holes, and then [end if]you are unceremoniously dumped on the ground just out side of the pit. You crawl a few steps away, just in case they suddenly get horny again!";
			dislodge S.
