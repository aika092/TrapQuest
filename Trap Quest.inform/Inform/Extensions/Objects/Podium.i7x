Podium by Objects begins here.


podium is a thing.  podium is not portable.  podium is in Dungeon31.  The printed name of podium is "[TQlink of item described]stage[TQxlink of item described][shortcut-desc][verb-desc of item described]".  The text-shortcut of podium is "st".  The description of podium is "A small stage with a podium.".  Understand "stage" as podium.  podium has a number called charge.

Definition: A podium (called I) is immune to change:
	decide yes.

Check climbing podium:
	try entering the podium instead.

Check entering podium:
	if the player is immobile, say "Aren't you a bit tied up at the moment?" instead;
	if the player is in danger, say "You would, but you are currently in a fight." instead;
	if the player is not able to use manual dexterity, say "You don't have the manual dexterity needed to climb up there." instead;
	if the player is prone, say "You would need to be standing up." instead;[now we can assume the player can get onto the podium]
	say "[if seconds > 0]Giving into temptation, you[otherwise]You[end if] quickly climb up on the stage and [if diaper quest is 1]suddenly feel compelled to turn and look out.  Looking around you can imagine what it would be like to be part of such a humiliating performance - you can feel the warm clammy feeling of a full diaper, the laughs of the crowd as you struggle to move around normally, pawing at your nappy with fists locked within tight pink mittens, and sucking nervously on your pacifier[otherwise]turn to look out. Looking around you can imagine the cold bite of the iron cuffs around your wrists and ankles, chaining you, while bidders shout out their offers for you, their eyes raking you over, making you feel defenceless. You shiver once more as the Auctioneer steps up and manhandles you, his hands exposing your assets to the onlookers all while calling out for higher bids, urging them on[end if].

Closing your eyes you can feel another shiver run though you. Taking a deep breath you hold it for a moment then let out slowly. ";
	now seconds is 6;
	arouse 660;
	let B be a random off-stage plentiful bracelet;
	if the charge of podium > 0 or the class of the player is princess or the class of the player is royal slave or the number of alive royal guards is 0:
		now the charge of the podium is 500;
		say "[if (the sex addiction of the player < 10 and diaper quest is 0) or (the diaper addiction of the player < 10 and diaper quest is 1)]You realise you're actually getting aroused by the thought!  You push the bizarre fantasy to the back of your mind, and[otherwise]Your imagination runs wild!  You feel a bit more aroused from the experience.  You[end if] get down from the stage." instead;
	otherwise if a random number between 1 and 3 > 1 and B is bracelet and the number of on-stage solid gold bracelets is 0:
		now B is solid gold;
		set shortcut of B;
		now B is in the location of the player;
		say "[if (the sex addiction of the player < 10 and diaper quest is 0) or (the diaper addiction of the player < 10 and diaper quest is 1)]You realise you're actually getting aroused by the thought!  You push the bizarre fantasy to the back of your mind, and[otherwise]Your imagination runs wild!  You feel a bit more aroused from the experience.  You[end if] open your eyes.  Looking down you see that a shiny [printed name of B] has fallen down to the ground behind the stage.  It looks valuable!  Maybe it was stealthily dropped by a slave who didn't want it becoming the property of her new master...";
		compute autotaking B;
	otherwise:
		let M be a random alive royal guard;
		anger M;
		now M is interested;
		now the boredom of M is 0;
		now the last-interaction of M is 2;
		now the sleep of M is 0;
		now M is in the location of the player;
		if diaper quest is 1:
			let P be a random pink pacifier;
			let N be a random mittens;
			let D be a random eligible diaper;
			if P is actually summonable, summon P cursed;
			if N is actually summonable, summon N cursed;
			if there is a worn diaper:
				now D is a random worn diaper;
			otherwise:
				repeat with K running through worn knickers:
					only destroy K;
				summon D cursed;
			now the urine-soak of D is the soak-limit of D;
			if diaper lover >= 4, now the mess of D is 10;
			say "Opening your eyes, you yelp as you realise it wasn't your imagination at all!  Blinking your eyes, you gasp in surprise and stare in shock at your [if M is worn]mitten-clad hands and [end if]drooping [D]!  [if P is worn]You try to spit out your new [P] but it is stuck in your mouth!  [end if][first custom style]'DISGUSTING!'[roman type] yells a voice.  Swallowing, you look up to see the [M]!  He marches towards the stage.";
			say "Pressing a concealed button at the front of the stage, the guard triggers a mechanical trap door which catapults you down to the ground in front of him.  [bold type]You are now on your knees.[line break][first custom style]'This show is cancelled.  You can't just soil yourself in the middle of a performance like that!  I'm going to have to refund all those tickets... and as for you, if you are going to mess your Pampers like a baby, I'm going to treat you like one.  Stay on your knees.'[roman type][line break]";
			now the previous-babification of M is 1; [prevents flavour where the guard 'changes how he's looking at you']
			decrease the health of M by 5; [This stops him changing the player, and will instead punish further.]
		otherwise:
			let A be a random pair of anklecuffs;
			let W be a random pair of wristcuffs;
			let S be a random slave collar;
			if A is actually summonable:
				summon A locked;
			if W is actually summonable:
				summon W locked;
				now W is bound-in-front;
			if S is actually summonable:
				summon S cursed;
			say "Opening your eyes you move forward to step off the stage only to be brought up short by the chains binding you.  Blinking your eyes you gasp in surprise and stare in shock at the chains binding you, the very real chains.  [if A is worn and W is worn]You are now wearing a [A] and a [W]!  [otherwise if A is worn]You are now wearing a [A]!  [otherwise if W is worn]You are now wearing a [W]!  [end if][if S is worn]You have a [printed name of S] around your neck!  [end if][first custom style]'SOLD!'[roman type] yells the Auctioneer as he slams his gravel down on the podium.  Swallowing, you shiver as he yanks at your chains, hauling you forward to meet the winning bidder and your new Master... the [M]!
			
			[first custom style]'Get on your knees, slave.'[roman type]  He pulls you by [if the largeness of hair > 2]your hair[otherwise]the neck[end if] and you trip over your bondage, landing on your knees.  The magical scene behind you disappears, leaving you with an empty stage, the [M], and [if the sex addiction of the player < 13]a decision to be made - fight, flight or fuck?[otherwise]his waiting [manly-penis].[end if]";
		now the stance of the player is 1;
	now the charge of the podium is 500 instead.

Check drinking podium:
	try entering the noun instead.

Understand "climb on [something]", "climb up on [something]", "climb onto [something]" as climbing.

auto-pod is a number that varies.

To compute podium action:
	if auto-pod is 0 and the player is upright and the charge of podium <= 0 and the player is not immobile and the player is not in danger and the player is able to use manual dexterity:
		if a random number between 14 and 20 < the sex addiction of the player:
			say "You can't help yourself - you want to get back up on that podium and experience that submissive fantasy again!";
			try entering podium;
			now auto-pod is 1;
			now another-turn is 1.


Podium ends here.
