Looking around you can imagine the cold bite of the iron cuffs around your wrists and ankles, chaining you, while bidders shout out their offers for you, their eyes raking you over, making you feel defenceless.

To compute podium action:
	if auto-pod is 0 and the player is upright and the charge of podium <= 0 and the player is not immobile and the player is not in danger and the player is able to use manual dexterity:
		if a random number between 14 and 20 < the delicateness of the player:
