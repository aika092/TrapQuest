PC Monitor by Objects begins here.

A video-monitor is a kind of thing. A video-monitor is not portable. [A video-monitor has a number called currentlyOn. A video-monitor has a number called currentCall. ]

A video-monitor has a thing called video-caller. The video-caller of a video-monitor is usually the throne.
A video-monitor can be recording-disgrace or not recording-disgrace. A video-monitor is usually not recording-disgrace.
A video-monitor has a number called call-cooldown.
A video-monitor has a number called currentlyOn.
