Bondage Framework by Bondage begins here.

A clothing can be wristless, wrist-unbound, wrist-bound-in-front or wrist-bound-behind (this is the wrist-restriction property). Clothing is usually wristless.
Definition: a clothing is wrist locking:
	if it is not wristless, decide yes;
	decide no.
Definition: a clothing is wrist locked:
	if it is wrist-bound-in-front or it is wrist-bound-behind, decide yes;
	decide no.
Definition: yourself is wrist bound:
	if there is worn wrist locked clothing, decide yes;
	decide no.
Definition: yourself is wrist bound in front:
	if there is worn wrist-bound-in-front clothing, decide yes;
	decide no.
Definition: yourself is wrist bound behind:
	if there is worn wrist-bound-behind clothing, decide yes;
	decide no.

A clothing can be ankleless, ankle-unbound or ankle-bound (this is the ankle-restriction property). Clothing is usually ankleless.
Definition: a clothing is ankle locking:
	if it is not ankleless, decide yes;
	decide no.
Definition: yourself is ankle bound:
	if there is worn ankle-bound clothing, decide yes;
	decide no.

A clothing can be neckless, neck-unbound or neck-bound (this is the neck-restriction property). [If a clothing is neck locked then it connects to the player's neck, either by being a neck item itself or connected to one.]
Definition: a clothing is neck locking:
	if it is not neckless, decide yes;
	decide no.
Definition: a clothing is neck locked:
	if it is neck-bound and there is worn neck covering clothing, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a clothing is restrictive rather than unrestrictive:
	if the restrictivity of it > 0, decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide which number is the restrictivity of (C - a clothing):
	let R be 0;
	if C is wrist locking, increase R by 1;
	if C is ankle locking, increase R by 1;
	if C is neck locked, increase R by 1;
	decide on R.

To decide which number is the bondage dexterity penalty of the player:
	let D be 0;
	repeat with C running through worn restrictive clothing:
		increase D by (the restrictivity of C) * (the restrictivity of C); [The more parts of the body this item connects, the more harshly it affects the player's dexterity.]
	decide on D.

bondage is a kind of clothing. bondage is usually metal. bondage is usually unique. bondage is usually manly.

Definition: a bondage is discovered varied: decide no.
Definition: a bondage is too boring: decide no.
Definition: a bondage is stealable: decide no.
Definition: a bondage is disintegration-protected: decide yes.
Definition: a bondage is magic-enhanceable: decide no.

To decide which number is the bartering value of (T - a bondage) for (M - a dominatrix):
	decide on 2.

To say MonsterOfferAcceptFlav of (M - a dominatrix) to (T - a bondage):
	say "[speech style of M]'Hmm, I must admit, that would go great in my collection. [if M is unfriendly]Fine, I'll leave you alone, for now[otherwise]You have my thanks[end if].'[roman type][line break]".

To say ShortDesc of (T - a bondage):
	say "bondage".

bondage-cooldown is a number that varies. [bondage-cooldown is 200.]
An all time based rule (this is the bondage cooldown rule):
	decrease bondage-cooldown by time-seconds.
Definition: yourself is ready for more bondage:
	if tutorial is 1 or bondage protection >= 2, decide no;
	if bondage-cooldown <= 0:
		if the player is getting unlucky, decide yes;
	otherwise if bondage-cooldown <= 870 / (tough-shit + 1):
		if the player is getting very unlucky, decide yes;
	decide no.
To reset bondage timer:
	now bondage-cooldown is 900 / (tough-shit + 1).

Definition: a clothing is application appropriate: decide no.
Definition: a bondage (called C) is application appropriate: [stuff that's application appropriate and summonable can be applied by NPCs at any time]
	if C is fetish appropriate, decide yes;
	decide no.
Definition: a submissive collar (called C) is application appropriate: [stuff that's application appropriate and summonable can be applied by NPCs at any time]
	if C is fetish appropriate and C is not unique, decide yes;
	decide no.

bondage-successfully-applied is initially false.
early-bondage-check is initially false. [NPC is doing this before sex. So maybe don't put a chastity device on, if vaginal sex is on the cards.]
To compute bondage application check of (M - a monster):
	now bondage-successfully-applied is false;
	if the player is ready for more bondage:
		let CM be current-monster;
		now current-monster is M;
		let C be a random application appropriate off-stage actually summonable clothing;
		if C is a thing:
			compute M bondage-forcing C;
			reset bondage timer;
			now bondage-successfully-applied is true;
		now current-monster is CM.


To compute (M - a monster) bondage-forcing (C - a clothing):
	say BondageAnnounceFlav of M for C;
	say BondageForceFlav of M for C;
	summon C locked;
	compute M keylocking C;

	if M is intelligent, say "[speech style of M]'[if early-bondage-check is true]Before we begin, [end if][one of]I have something for you[or]I have been saving this for the right person[or]I think you need to better learn to respect your superiors. And I have just the thing[in random order]...'[roman type][line break]";
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] pulls out a [MediumDesc of C]!".

To say BondageForceFlav of (M - a monster) for (C - a clothing):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] forces [NameDesc of C] onto you!".
To say BondageForceFlav of (M - a monster) for (C - a gag):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] pushes [NameDesc of C] into your mouth!".
To say BondageForceFlav of (M - a monster) for (C - an ankle bond):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] forces your ankles into [NameDesc of C]!".
To say BondageForceFlav of (M - a monster) for (C - a wrist bond):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] forces your wrists into [NameDesc of C]!".
To say BondageForceFlav of (M - a monster) for (C - a chastity cage):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] forces your [ShortDesc of penis] into [NameDesc of C]!".

To say BondageAfterFlav of (M - a monster) for (C - a clothing):
	say "[speech style of M]'[one of]A perfect fit[or]It suits you well[or]Much better[in random order].'[roman type][line break]".
