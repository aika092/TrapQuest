Check taking something:
	if the noun is held by a monster:
		let M be a random monster holding the noun;
		say "[BigNameDesc of M] is holding [NameDesc of the noun]." instead;
	if the noun is not bag of holding and not-in-bag-things >= carried-limit:
		if there is a worn bag of holding:
			if the noun is never-in-bag, say "You are at your limit for carrying [if diaper messing >= 6]messy diapers, [end if]food and drink, and other items that can't go in your bag of holding. You'll have to drop some if you want to pick up more." instead;

	repeat with H running through bag of holding in the location of the player:
		unless the noun is H or the noun is not worn:
