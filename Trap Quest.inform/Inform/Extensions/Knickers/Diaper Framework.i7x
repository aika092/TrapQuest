The setup starting diapers rule is listed in the setup starting items rules.
		
To say diaper-saturation-desc:

Report wearing diaper:
	if the urine-soak of the noun > 0:
		say "The cold wet squelch as you put the [noun] on makes you [if the diaper addiction of the player < 10]shudder involuntarily.  How gross[otherwise if the diaper addiction of the player < 14]squirm uncomfortably.  It's cold and clammy[otherwise]shiver with arousal[end if].";

Check taking a messed knickers:
	say "[variable custom style]There's no way I'm touching that.[roman type][line break]" instead.

Check wearing a messed knickers:
	say "[variable custom style]There's no way I'm touching that.[roman type][line break]" instead.

Check taking off a worn messed knickers:
	say "[variable custom style]There's no way I'm touching that until I've found [if the bimbo of the player < 13]a way to change and clean myself[otherwise]someone to change me[end if].[roman type][line break]" instead.

To say MonsterOfferRejectFlav of (M - an intelligent monster) to (T - a diaper):
	say "[speech style of M]'Do I look like I have problems controlling my bladder?!'[roman type][line break]".

To decide which object is the unique-upgrade-target of (C - a diaper):
	decide on nothing.

To decide which object is the potential-upgrade-target of (C - a diaper):
	let chosenD be nothing;
	repeat with D running through eligible diapers: [Find the next most padded diaper at the same humiliation level]
		if the initial outrage of D is the initial outrage of C and D is not waddle diaper and the soak-limit of D > the soak-limit of C:
			if chosenD is nothing:
				now chosenD is D;
			otherwise:
				if the soak-limit of chosenD > the soak-limit of D, now chosenD is D;
	if chosenD is nothing:
		repeat with D running through eligible diapers: [If we can't increase the padding, find the next most humiliating diaper]
			if the initial outrage of D > the initial outrage of C and D is not waddle diaper:
				if chosenD is nothing:
					now chosenD is D;
				otherwise:
					if the initial outrage of chosenD > the initial outrage of D, now chosenD is D;
	if chosenD is nothing and the bimbo of the player > 8, decide on a random off-stage waddle diaper; [We've reached the end of all available diapers, time to force the player into the crazy waddle diaper!]
	decide on chosenD. [The waddle diaper is already on-stage, so no more transformations happen.]

Definition: a diaper (called D) is untransformable:
	if the potential-upgrade-target of D is nothing, decide yes;
	decide no.

Check taking off worn diaper:
	if there is a worn I love my wet nappies T-shirt and the urine-soak of the noun is not 0 and the total-soak of the noun < (the soak-limit of the noun / 2) and the noun is total protection, say "Your [printed name of random worn I love my wet nappies T-shirt] is somehow magically preventing you from removing the [noun]!" instead;
	if the noun is glued:
		try tearing off the noun;
		if the noun is glued:
			do nothing instead.
