[!<DecideWhichSpatialCoordinateIsTheMapSumOfTwoCoordinates>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which spatial coordinate is the map sum of (V1 - a spatial coordinate) and (V2 - a spatial coordinate):
	let L be the maze level part of V1 plus the maze level part of V2;
	let L be the remainder after dividing L by 25;
	let E be the easting part of V1 plus the easting part of V2;
	let E be the remainder after dividing E by 25;
	let N be the northing part of V1 plus the northing part of V2;
	let N be the remainder after dividing N by 25;
	let the sum be the spatial coordinate with maze level part L easting part E northing part N;
	decide on the sum.


[!<DecideIfSomethingIsInDirection>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide if there is something to the (D - a direction):
	now neighbour finder is tile finder;
	if D is N-viable, decide yes;
	decide no;
	let R be the room D of tile finder;
	if R is solid rock or R is nothing:
		decide no;
	otherwise:
		now Neighbour Finder is R;
		[say "Shape of [tile finder] is [shape of tile finder]. Shape of [R] is [shape of R]. Direction is [D].";]
		if D is desired:
			let Sh be the shape of tile finder;
			if D is north and N part of Sh is 1, decide yes;
			if D is east and E part of Sh is 1, decide yes;
			if D is south and S part of Sh is 1, decide yes;
			if D is west and W part of Sh is 1, decide yes;
	decide no.
