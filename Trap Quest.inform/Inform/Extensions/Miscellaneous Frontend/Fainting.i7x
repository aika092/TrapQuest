Fainting by Miscellaneous Frontend begins here.

AutoFainting is an action applying to nothing.
Check AutoFainting:
	if tutorial is 1, say "In the main game, this acts as your safe word to let you always have a way to revoke consent when NPCs are doing naughty things to you. It bails you out of the game no matter what your situation and lets you do a soft reset, in exchange for your most valuable jewellery. However in this tutorial it would break everything, so it is disabled. If you want to revoke consent during the tutorial, please instead type [bold type]'quit'[roman type]." instead.
Carry Out AutoFainting:
	say "[if the player is able to speak]Say[otherwise]Think[end if] the 'safe word' phrase? This will make you lose your most valuable jewellery. ";
	if the player is consenting:
		now the fainting reason of the player is 50;
		execute fainting.
Understand "faint", "i like pineapple on pizza", "i like pineapple pizza", "pineapple pizza", "pineapple" as AutoFainting.

[!<sexChanged:Integer>*

Set to 1 when the player is sex changed, telling us that the next time the player faints, we should mention it. Then it gets set to 2 so we don't do that again the following time the player faints.

*!]
Sex-changed is a number that varies. Sex-changed is 0.

[!<newlyTattooed:Integer>*

Set to 1 when the player gets a property tattoo as they faint so that we know to mention it.

*!]
Newly-tattooed is a number that varies. Newly-tattooed is 0.

[!<tentacled:Integer>*

This tells us that a tentacle monster saw us faint, and therefore we could get turned into a tentacle breeder potentially.

tentacled is a number that varies. tentacled is 0.

To say First Time TG Fainting Story:
	say "BZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz...[line break]You feel weird. You feel like you are floating through a dream world. You slowly try to open your eyes, and realise they're already open, you just can't see anything. You realise you aren't breathing, and try to breathe in. When it doesn't work, you instantly realise what feels weird - your lungs are full of water! But somehow you aren't running out of oxygen. It takes you a long time to get used to the sensation of not air breathing vulnerable.[line break]You try to move your arms, and realise you are completely underwater. You spread them out wide and in front of you, and you feel the metal walls of what must be the virtual reality machine capsule. What is going on?[line break][second custom style]'Oh, [if the player is gendered female or the bimbo of the player > 6]s[end if]he's woken up.'[roman type][line break]You hear the words shakily through the liquid you are floating in.[line break][second custom style]'Hey there, how are you doing? As per the contract, the longer you take to win the game, the longer we get to transform your body!'[line break][first custom style][line break]Transform my WHAT?[line break][second custom style][line break]'As you hopefully read, whenever your body proportions in-game are more girly than your body proportions in real life, we'll slowly use our state-of-the-art Hormone Fluid Chamber to make you just like your character! You might be able to feel some of the changes already.'[roman type][line break]";

This is not going according to plan![line break][end if][line break][second custom style]'Your character won't to be able to reduce her body proportions to below what your real life body is like, so be careful or you could be in a lot of trouble! And of course we *can* reverse the process for you, but it's very costly - you'd have to spend some of your winnings to do that! If you have any...[line break]Something else feels off, but you can't tell what. You reach to scratch your balls, and squeal with shock as you find a vagina there instead. [second custom style]'SURPRISE!!!'[roman type][line break]The girl's voice is overly enthusiastic.[line break][second custom style]'[if the player is female]You got transformed into a girl in the game[otherwise]We finished shrinking down your old pee pee into nothing[end if], so we've already gone ahead and properly turned you into a girl! Well I mean obviously it's artificial, I mean we can't change your DNA, but we *can* give you this, and make sure that you're kept pumped full of girly hormones for the rest of your days with a special implant right where your prostate used to be!'[roman type][line break][if the bimbo of the player < 11]You thrash around as much as possible to show your frustration.[otherwise]You peel back the folds of your new pussy and timidly explore your new sex.[end if][line break][second custom style]'We'll take that to mean you like it! Well that's good because the reversal process is a bit sketchy and VERY expensive so it looks like you might be staying like this for a while longer! Anyway that's enough from us, time is ticking! Let's send you back into the game. Good luck baby!'[roman type][line break]".
