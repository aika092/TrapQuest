Announcements by Miscellaneous Frontend begins here.

To compute announcements:

		say "This game has a 'dark mode' which is a lot nicer on the eyes. However it is still in alpha, because it is buggy when you use the 'restart' command and it only works with Windows Git, and even then, it doesn't always work with the inventory window. However, if you are in Windows Git, and want to use it for now, you need to do the following:[paragraph break]Go into Git > Options, and in the 'Colours' Box, click on the colour under 'Text' and change it to white (or whatever light text colour you prefer). Then click on the 'Background' colour box and in the bottom right of the window that opens, change the Red value to 24, the Green value to 13, and the Blue value to 1. This way your main window will have the same colour scheme as the graphical windows, which are handled by the game itself.[paragraph break]Have you done all that, and would therefore like to enable dark mode?

			say "For your information: When you go for a 'Normal Start', lots of fetish settings can now be swapped between 'never', 'not now', 'yes this time' and 'always' as opposed to just 'enabled' and 'disabled'. The reason for this is that you are being encouraged to customise potential future 'Random Start' runs. What this means is that when an option is set to 'not now' or 'yes this time', it will be randomly set to enabled or disabled each time you choose Random Start. All other settings will remain as you have previously configured them. So if for example you always want TG Fetish enabled but never want watersports fetish enabled and you want everything else to be randomised and surprise you, that is now possible.[line break][bold type]Press any key to continue.[roman type][line break]";

			say "Looking for more ways to reduce the game lag? Once you get used to how the various different objects can be interacted with, I'd strongly recommend switching your 'Button Layout' to Popup Buttons. You can do this from the GUI settings submenu at any point. Doing this lets the images render a bit larger, because there's no space reserved for buttons, and also makes the game go faster as the engine has to think about several less images each turn.[paragraph break]Or, I can make the change for you now. Would you like to try out the Popup Buttons setting? ";

			clear the screen;
			say "The new recommended setting for image cutscenes is that they all appear in the location window. This is because even if they appear rather small at first, they can now be clicked on and examined in order to push a zoomed-in version to the map window. This is especially advised for anyone playing on a monitor that's not particularly high resolution, as cutscene images in the main window can only be cropped, not resized. Would you like me to make that setting change for you now? ";
