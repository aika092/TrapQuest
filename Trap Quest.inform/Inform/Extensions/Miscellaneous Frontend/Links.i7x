Part 0 - Backend Hacky Stuff

waitingForChar is initially false.

To decide what number is the actual chosen letter:
	(- VM_KeyChar() -).

To decide what number is the chosen letter:
	now waitingForChar is true;
	decide on the actual chosen letter.

To decide which number is the StrToInt of (T - a text):
	if number of characters in T is 1:
		if character number 1 in T is "0", decide on 0;
		if character number 1 in T is "1", decide on 1;
		if character number 1 in T is "2", decide on 2;
		if character number 1 in T is "3", decide on 3;
		if character number 1 in T is "4", decide on 4;
		if character number 1 in T is "5", decide on 5;
		if character number 1 in T is "6", decide on 6;
		if character number 1 in T is "7", decide on 7;
		if character number 1 in T is "8", decide on 8;
		if character number 1 in T is "9", decide on 9;
	decide on -1.

Glulx input handling rule for a char-event:
	let N be the glk event value 1;
	if N is consent-responsive:
		if N is 89 or N is 121, say "[bold type]Yes[roman type][line break]";
		otherwise say "[bold type]No[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise if N >= 48 and N <= 57:
		say "[bold type][N - 48][roman type][line break]";
	now waitingForChar is false.

The default graphlink processing rule is not listed in the graphlink processing rulebook.

A graphlink processing rule for a g-element (called the link) (this is the Aika graphlink processing rule):
	if debugmode > 1, say "Processing graphlink for [candidate replacement command]. waitingForChar is [if waitingForChar is true]true[otherwise]false[end if].";
	unless the candidate replacement command is "":
		if PopupButtons > 0 and the candidate replacement command exactly matches the regular expression "x .*": [When we would normally examine something, we want to instead pull up the popup buttons. Unless they're already pulled up and the player has clicked on the examine button, in which case we want to actually do the action.]
			[do nothing;]
			if debugmode > 1, say "[bold type]Doing nothing, expecting buttons.[roman type][line break]";
		otherwise if waitingForChar is false: [output the replacement command as normal]
			cancel input in main window;
			now the glulx replacement command is the candidate replacement command;
			follow the command-showing rules;
			change the text of the player's command to the Glulx replacement command;
			now the glk event type is line-event;
			now the glk event value 1 is the number of characters in the glulx replacement command;
		otherwise: [If we're waiting on a *character*, we convert a hyperlink event to a char event here. Currently coded for yes/no hyperlinks and integers only.]
			cancel input in main window;

				now waitingForChar is false;
			otherwise if STI >= 0:
				now the glk event value 1 is STI + 48;
				say "[bold type][STI][roman type][line break]";
			otherwise if the candidate replacement command exactly matches the text "yes", case insensitively:
				now the glk event value 1 is 121;
				say "[bold type]Yes[roman type][line break]";
				now waitingForChar is false;
			otherwise if the candidate replacement command exactly matches the text "no", case insensitively:
				now the glk event value 1 is 110;
				say "[bold type]No[roman type][line break]";
				now waitingForChar is false;
		now the glk event window ref is the ref number of the acting main window;
		now the candidate replacement command is "";
		rule succeeds.

First for processing hyperlinks (This is the Aika char-inject with hyperlinks rule):
	if waitingForChar is true:
		now the glulx replacement command is entry (hyperlink ID) of the hyperlink list;
		let STI be the StrToInt of the glulx replacement command;
		if STI >= 0:
			now the glk event value 1 is STI + 48;
			now the glk event type is char-event;
			say "[bold type][STI][roman type][line break]";
		otherwise if the glulx replacement command exactly matches the text "yes", case insensitively:
			now the glk event type is char-event;
			now the glk event value 1 is 121;
			say "[bold type]Yes[roman type][line break]";
		otherwise if the glulx replacement command exactly matches the text "no", case insensitively:
			now the glk event type is char-event;
			now the glk event value 1 is 110;
			say "[bold type]No[roman type][line break]";
		if the glk event type is char-event:
			now waitingForChar is false;
			now the glulx replacement command is "";
			cancel input in main window;
			follow the command-showing rules;
		rule succeeds;
	continue the action.

Part 1 - Basic Links

To decide which number is linksCurrentlyEnabled:
	if (links-disabled is true and inventory hyperlinks is 0) or (excessiveHyperlinks is 0 and the graphics-window is g-present), decide on 0;
	decide on 1.

disambiguation-busy is initially false.
disambiguation-was-busy is initially false.

Before asking which do you mean (this is the Disambiguation Choices need clarification rule):
	now disambiguation-busy is true.

After asking which do you mean (this is the Disambiguation Choices no longer need clarification rule):
	force immediate inventory-focus redraw;
	zero focus stuff;
	display focus stuff;
	now disambiguation-busy is false.

Part 2 - Yes & No

Definition: yourself is in agreement: [Some issues with hyperlinks and yes/no]
	[if inline hyperlinks >= 1:
		say "(automatic yes)[line break]";
		decide yes;]
	if the player is consenting, decide yes;
	decide no.

To say yesnolink:
	if the player is not virtual or (actual inline hyperlinks >= 1 and YesNoPreference > 0), say "([link]yes[end link] / [link]no[end link]) ".

Figure of YesButton is the file "Special/Buttons/yes.png".
Figure of NoButton is the file "Special/Buttons/no.png".

currentlyConsenting is a number that varies. [0: Not asking the player a question; 1: Asking the player a yes/no question; 2: Asking the player a multiple choice question]

Definition: a text (called T) is consent-responsive:
	if T exactly matches the text "yes", case insensitively:
		decide yes;
	if T exactly matches the text "y", case insensitively:
		decide yes;
	if T exactly matches the text "no", case insensitively:
		decide yes;
	if T exactly matches the text "n", case insensitively:
		decide yes;
	decide no.

[A-Z is 65 - 90
a-z is 97 - 122
Y is 89; y is 121
N is 78; n is 110]

Definition: a number (called N) is consent-responsive:
	if N is 78 or N is 89 or N is 110 or N is 121, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: yourself is consenting:
	now currentlyConsenting is 1;
	refresh map zone;
	force immediate inventory-focus redraw;
	let inputNumber be 0;
	while inputNumber is not consent-responsive:
		say yesnolink;

		if inputNumber is not consent-responsive:
			say "Input not understood. Please choose Y or N.";
	conclude consenting;
	if inputNumber is 89 or inputNumber is 121, decide yes;
	decide no.

bigGameLoop is a number that varies. [If this is above 0, we are flagging that a long series of yes/no questions are about to be asked, and there's no need to refresh the map window between each one. We must remember to set it back to 0 and refresh the windows at the end of the lesson or whatever it is. Easiest way is with a 'conclude consenting' after 'now bigGameLoop is 0'.
0: Normal behaviour
1: Skip refreshing map window
2: Skip refreshing map window, including after multiple choice
3: Skip refreshing all windows
4: Skip refreshing all windows, including not refreshing map after multiple choice
]

To conclude consenting:
	now currentlyConsenting is 0;
	if gameover-flag is 0:
		[say "temporaryYesNoBackground is [temporaryYesNoBackground]. temporaryYesNoResetNeeded is [if temporaryYesNoResetNeeded is false]not [end if]true.";]
		if temporaryYesNoResetNeeded is true and temporaryYesNoBackground is not figure of no-image-yet, now temporaryYesNoBackground is figure of small image;
		zero focus stuff; [We empty the focus window to make sure it is rebuilt properly. By being forced to pause and choose an option, the player has seen any cutscenes, NPCs that left, etc.]
		repeat with G running through g-paused animation tracks:
			now G is g-unpaused;
		if bigGameLoop is 0 or (bigGameLoop is not 2 and bigGameLoop is not 4 and temporary-map-figure is not figure of no-image-yet):
			refresh map zone;
		otherwise:
			clear the map zone; [if we don't do this, and we use both Yes/No questions and multiple choice questions in the same big game loop, we get some ugly overlaps in the map window]
		if bigGameLoop < 3, render buffered stuff.

To temporaryYesNoBackgroundReset:
	[let W be current focus window;
	focus main window;
	say "temporaryYesNoBackgroundReset.";
	focus W;]
	now temporaryYesNoBackground is figure of small image;
	now temporaryYesNoResetNeeded is true.

[Works the same as normal consenting, but the player can be forced to say yes. Some things it'll be fun if the player can't say no after a while.]
Definition: yourself is bimbo consenting:
	if the player is consenting:
		decide yes;
	otherwise:
		if the player is not in a predicament room and (pledge-lesson-yes is implanted or the bimbo of the player >= a random number between 16 and 20):
			say "[if pledge-lesson-yes is implanted]The magic pledge activates.[line break][second custom style][otherwise][second custom style]Huh? [end if]Good [boy of the player]s always say yes! I pick yes![roman type][line break]";
			decide yes;
		decide no.

[works the same as normal consenting, unless bimbo forces the player to say no. For some things the 'bimbo' answer is no.]
Definition: yourself is reverse bimbo consenting:
	if the player is consenting:
		if the player is not in a predicament room and the bimbo of the player >= a random number between 16 and 20:
			say "[second custom style]No no no, I can't do that, I'm a [if diaper quest is 1]good [boy of the player][otherwise]mega-slut, and I'm going to act like a slut[end if].[roman type][line break]";
			decide no;

temporaryYesNoResetNeeded is initially true.

To render YesNoBackground:
	let F be YesNoBackground;
	if F is Figure of PokerCardDraw:

			increase X1 by (W - FXi) / 2; [centred horizontally]
		otherwise:
			increase Y1 by (H - FYi) / 2; [centred vertically]
		clear the map zone; [GUITODOMAYBE a bad idea?]
		display the image F in the graphics-window at X1 by Y1 with dimensions FXi by FYi.

To render YesNoButtons:
	let F be YesNoBackground;
	if F is Figure of no-image-yet, display entire map; [We have flagged that we still want to show the player the map in the background]
	otherwise clear the map zone;
	zero map-link-table;

				if linkid entry is hypermapskip, blank out the whole row.


Part 3 - Multiple Choice

player-numerical-response is a number that varies.

numerical-responses is a list of texts that varies. numerical-responses is {"","","","","","","","","",""}.

To decide which text is the chosen numerical response of (N - a number):
	if N is 0, now N is 10;
	if the number of entries in numerical-responses < N, decide on "";
	decide on entry N in numerical-responses.

To decide which text is chosen numerical response:
	decide on the chosen numerical response of player-numerical-response.

To set next numerical response to (T - a text):
	repeat with N running from 1 to 10:
		if entry N in numerical-responses is "":
			now entry N in numerical-responses is T;
			break.

To set numerical response (N - a number) to (T - a text):
	if N is 0, now N is 10;
	now entry N in numerical-responses is T.

[To decide which number is filled-numerical-responses:
	let N be 0;
	repeat with T running through numerical-responses:
		unless T is "", increase N by 1;
	decide on N.]

To compute single choice question (T - a text):
	reset multiple choice questions;
	set numerical response 1 to T;
	compute multiple choice question.

To compute multiple choice question:
	let inputNumber be 0;
	let validAnswer be 0;
	while validAnswer is 0:
		now currentlyConsenting is 2;
		unless YesNoBackground is Figure of PokerCardDraw and graphics-window is g-present: [no need for the text options if we also have the graphical option]
			repeat with E running from 1 to 10:
				let N be E;
				if N is 10, now N is 0;
				if entry E in numerical-responses is not "", say "[link][N]) [entry E in numerical-responses][as][N][end link][line break]";
		if gameover-flag is 0:
			display focus stuff;
			if the player is virtual, display stuff;
			if YesNoBackground is Figure of no-image-yet, display entire map; [We have flagged that we still want to show the player the map in the background]
			render YesNoBackground;
		now inputNumber is the chosen letter;
		if debugmode > 1, say "Numerical responses ([number of entries in numerical-responses] entries): [numerical-responses].[line break]input number: [inputNumber].";
		decrease inputNumber by 48; [convert key ID to integer]
		let INM be inputNumber;
		if INM is 0, now INM is 10;
		say line break;
		if INM > 0 and INM <= the number of entries in numerical-responses and entry INM in numerical-responses is not "", now validAnswer is 1;
		otherwise say "Input not understood. Please choose a valid number.";
	now player-numerical-response is inputNumber;
	conclude consenting. [refreshes the map window]

To compute single choice question (T - a text):
	reset multiple choice questions;
	set numerical response 1 to T;
	compute multiple choice question;
	now player-numerical-response is -1.


To reset multiple choice questions:
	[now numerical-responses is {"","","","","","","","","",""};] [this doesn't work because Inform is shit]
	truncate numerical-responses to 0 entries;
	repeat with N running from 1 to 10:
		add "" to numerical-responses.

leftNumber is initially -2.
rightNumber is initially -3.
upNumber is initially -4.
downNumber is initially -5.
enterNumber is initially -6.
spaceNumber is initially 32.
directionNumbersConfigured is initially false.
To configure direction numbers:
	while directionNumbersConfigured is false:
		say "[one of]First, the game needs to[or]The game will now[stopping] configure your arrow keys.";
		say "Please press the key you would like to be treated as your [bold type]up arrow[roman type]: ";
		now upNumber is the chosen letter;
		say line break;
		say "Please press the key you would like to be treated as your [bold type]down arrow[roman type]: ";
		now downNumber is the chosen letter;
		say line break;
		say "Please press the key you would like to be treated as your [bold type]left arrow[roman type]: ";
		now leftNumber is the chosen letter;
		say line break;
		say "Please press the key you would like to be treated as your [bold type]right arrow[roman type]: ";
		now rightNumber is the chosen letter;
		say line break;
		say "Are you sure you're happy with those choices? Choose [bold type]no[roman type] to configure your arrow keys again.";
		if the player is consenting:
			now directionNumbersConfigured is true;
			say "Arrow keys successfully configured.".
