Part 0 - Backend Hacky Stuff

waitingForChar is initially false.

To decide what number is the actual chosen letter:
	(- VM_KeyChar() -).

To decide what number is the chosen letter:
	now waitingForChar is true;
	decide on the actual chosen letter.

To decide which number is the StrToInt of (T - a text):
	if number of characters in T is 1:
		if character number 1 in T is "0", decide on 0;
		if character number 1 in T is "1", decide on 1;
		if character number 1 in T is "2", decide on 2;

	decide on -1.

Glulx input handling rule for a char-event:
	let N be the glk event value 1;
	if N is consent-responsive:
		if N is 89 or N is 121, say "[bold type]Yes[roman type][line break]";
		otherwise say "[bold type]No[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise if N >= 48 and N <= 57:

	now waitingForChar is false.

The default graphlink processing rule is not listed in the graphlink processing rulebook.

A graphlink processing rule for a g-element (called the link) (this is the Aika graphlink processing rule):

		rule succeeds.

First for processing hyperlinks (This is the Aika char-inject with hyperlinks rule):
	if waitingForChar is true:

	continue the action.



Part 1 - Basic Links


To decide which number is linksCurrentlyEnabled:
	if (links-disabled is true and inventory hyperlinks is 0) or (excessiveHyperlinks is 0 and inventory-busy is 0 and the focus-window is g-present and the clothing-focus-window is g-present and (the inventory-focus-window is g-present or the inventory-window is g-present) and the map-window is g-present), decide on 0;
	decide on 1.

[!<SayTQLink>+

Start of a hyperlink.

+!]
To say TQlink:
	if inline hyperlinks >= 1, say "[link]".

[!<SayTQlinkOfThing>+

Start of a hyperlink for a thing that's been properly coded.

+!]
To say TQlink of (T - a thing):
	if ((inline hyperlinks >= 1 or disambiguation-busy is true) and the text-shortcut of T is not "") or the link-disambiguation-ID of T > 0, say "[link]".

A thing has a number called the link-disambiguation-ID.
linkDisambiguationHighest is a number that varies.
An advance counters rule (this is the reset link disambiguation rule):
	if linkDisambiguationHighest > 0:
		now linkDisambiguationHighest is 0;
		repeat with T running through things:
			now the link-disambiguation-ID of T is 0.
To assign link disambiguation ID to (T - a thing):
	increase linkDisambiguationHighest by 1;
	now the link-disambiguation-ID of T is linkDisambiguationHighest.

[!<SayTQxlinkOfThing>+

End of a hyperlink for a thing that's been properly coded, where clicking examines the thing.

+!]
To say TQxlink of (T - a thing):

		say " ([Disambiguation-ID-count / 2])";
		now the disambiguation-ID of T is disambiguation-ID-count / 2;
		increase disambiguation-ID-count by 1; [It seems to go up twice each time for no reason. Hence we do the halving thing.]
	otherwise if inline hyperlinks >= 1 and the text-shortcut of T is not "":
		say "[as]x [text-shortcut of T][end link]".


[*<SayTQdlink>+

End of a hyperlink.

+!]
To say TQdlink:
	if inline hyperlinks >= 1, say "[end link]".

Part 2 - Yes & No


Definition: yourself is in agreement: [Some issues with hyperlinks and yes/no]
	[if inline hyperlinks >= 1:
		say "(automatic yes)[line break]";
		decide yes;]
	if the player is consenting, decide yes;
	decide no.

To say yesnolink:
	if the player is not virtual or (actual inline hyperlinks >= 1 and YesNoPreference > 0), say "([link]yes[end link] / [link]no[end link]) ".

Figure of YesButton is the file "Special/Buttons/yes.png".
Figure of NoButton is the file "Special/Buttons/no.png".

currentlyConsenting is initially false.

Definition: a text (called T) is consent-responsive:
	if T exactly matches the text "yes", case insensitively:
		decide yes;
	if T exactly matches the text "y", case insensitively:
		decide yes;
	if T exactly matches the text "no", case insensitively:
		decide yes;
	if T exactly matches the text "n", case insensitively:
		decide yes;
	decide no.

[A-Z is 65 - 90
a-z is 97 - 122
Y is 89; y is 121
N is 78; n is 110]

Definition: a number (called N) is consent-responsive:
	if N is 78 or N is 89 or N is 110 or N is 121, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: yourself is consenting:
	now currentlyConsenting is true;
	refresh the map-window;
	force immediate inventory-focus redraw;
	force immediate clothing-focus redraw;
	let inputNumber be 0;
	while inputNumber is not consent-responsive:
		say yesnolink;
		display focus stuff;
		if the player is virtual, display stuff;
		now inputNumber is the chosen letter;
		say line break;
		if inputNumber is not consent-responsive:
			say "Input not understood. Please choose Y or N.";
	conclude consenting;
	zero focus stuff; [We empty the focus window to make sure it is rebuilt properly]
	if inputNumber is 89 or inputNumber is 121, decide yes;
	decide no.

bigGameLoop is a number that varies. [If this is above 0, we are flagging that a long series of yes/no questions are about to be asked, and there's no need to refresh the map window between each one. We must remember to set it back to 0 and refresh the windows at the end of the lesson or whatever it is. Easiest way is with a 'conclude consenting' after 'now bigGameLoop is 0'.
0: Normal behaviour
1: Skip refreshing map window
2: Skip refreshing all windows
]

To conclude consenting:
	now currentlyConsenting is false;
	if bigGameLoop is 0, refresh the map-window;
	if bigGameLoop < 2, render buffered stuff.

[Some things it'll be fun if the player can't say no after a while.]
Definition: yourself is bimbo consenting:
	if the player is consenting:
		decide yes;
	otherwise:
		if the implant of ultimate-lesson-yes is 1 or the bimbo of the player >= a random number between 16 and 20:
			say "[if the implant of ultimate-lesson-yes is 1]The curse activates.[line break][second custom style][otherwise][second custom style]Huh? [end if]Good [boy of the player]s always say yes! I pick yes![roman type][line break]";
			decide yes;
		decide no.

[For some things the 'bimbo' answer is no.]
Definition: yourself is reverse bimbo consenting:
	if the player is consenting:
		if the bimbo of the player >= a random number between 16 and 20:
			say "[second custom style]No no no, I can't do that, I'm a [if diaper quest is 1]good girl[otherwise]a mega-slut, and I'm going to act like a slut[end if].[roman type][line break]";
			decide no;
		decide yes;
	otherwise:
		decide no.

To render YesNoButtons:
	let F be YesNoBackground;
	if F is Figure of no-image-yet, display entire map; [We still want to show the player the map]
	zero map-link-table;
	zero map-button-table;
	let H be the height of the map-window;
	let W be the width of the map-window;
	[Calculate background image size]
	if F is not Figure of no-image-yet:
		let XRatio be (W * 1.0) / the pixel-width of F;
		let FY be the pixel-height of F * XRatio;
		let FYi be FY to the nearest whole number;
		display the image F in the map-window at 0 by 0 with dimensions W by FYi;
	[Calculate button image sizes and locations]
	let buttonSize be H / 3;
	if W < H, now buttonSize is W / 3;
	let X be (W - (buttonSize * 2)) / 3;
	let Y be (H / 2) - (buttonSize / 2);
	if actual inline hyperlinks >= 1 and YesNoPreference > 0:
		display the image Figure of YesButton in the map-window at X by Y with dimensions buttonSize by buttonSize;
		set a graphlink in the map-window identified as hypermapyes from X by Y to (X + buttonSize) by (Y + buttonSize) as "yes";
		draw a box lightModeFullGreen in the map-window from X by Y to (X + buttonSize) by (Y + buttonSize) with 1 pixel line-weight, inset;
		increase X by buttonSize + X;
		display the image Figure of NoButton in the map-window at X by Y with dimensions buttonSize by buttonSize;
		set a graphlink in the map-window identified as hypermapno from X by Y to (X + buttonSize) by (Y + buttonSize) as "no";
		draw a box lightModeFullRed in the map-window from X by Y to (X + buttonSize) by (Y + buttonSize) with 1 pixel line-weight, inset.


Part 3 - Multiple Choice

player-numerical-response is a number that varies.

A numerical-response is a kind of thing.

numerical-response-1 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-1):
	decide on 1.
numerical-response-2 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-2):
	decide on 2.
numerical-response-3 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-3):
	decide on 3.
numerical-response-4 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-4):
	decide on 4.
numerical-response-5 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-5):
	decide on 5.
numerical-response-6 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-6):
	decide on 6.
numerical-response-7 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-7):
	decide on 7.
numerical-response-8 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-8):
	decide on 8.
numerical-response-9 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-9):
	decide on 9.
numerical-response-0 is a numerical-response.
To decide which number is the numerical-response-value of (N - numerical-response-0):
	decide on 0.

To decide which object is the chosen numerical response of (N - a number):
	repeat with R running through numerical-response:
		if the numerical-response-value of R is N, decide on R.

To decide which object is the chosen numerical response:
	decide on the chosen numerical response of player-numerical-response.

To set next numerical response to (T - a text):
	repeat with R running through numerical-response:
		if the printed name of R is "":
			now the printed name of R is T;
			break.

To set numerical response (N - a number) to (T - a text):
	repeat with R running through numerical-response:
		if the numerical-response-value of R is N, now the printed name of R is T.

To compute multiple choice question:
	let inputNumber be 0;
	let validAnswer be 0;
	while validAnswer is 0:
		repeat with R running through numerical-response:
			if the printed name of R is not "":
				let N be the numerical-response-value of R;
				say "[link][N]) [R][as][N][end link][line break]";
		display focus stuff;
		if the player is virtual, display stuff;
		now inputNumber is the chosen letter;
		decrease inputNumber by 48; [convert key ID to integer]
		say line break;
		repeat with R running through numerical-response:
			if the printed name of R is not "" and inputNumber is the numerical-response-value of R, now validAnswer is 1;
		if validAnswer is 0, say "Input not understood. Please choose a valid number.";
	now player-numerical-response is inputNumber.

To reset multiple choice questions:
	repeat with R running through numerical-response:
		now the printed name of R is "".
