[
    Selkie thinks that:

    - 'manly-penis' is just for referring to a dick in general.
    - (so player-manly-penis is now provided for the player's 'manly penis')
    - sissy-penis is intended for downplaying the player's penis
    - vagina is intended for the player's vagina
    - player-penis is intended for adaptively referring to player-penis
    - hence Selkie has changed player-penis to now use the new
      player-manly-penis instead of the previous manly-penis.
    - plain-sissy-penis is for bare sissy penis terms, player or monster
    - DickDesc of monster now uses appropriate terms when it's sissy-ish
