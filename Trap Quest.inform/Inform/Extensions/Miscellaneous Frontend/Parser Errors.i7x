[After asking which do you mean (this is the Disambiguation Choices cause crashes rule):
	if inline hyperlinks > 0 and newbie tips is 1, say "[bold type][one of]Do not use a hyperlink here, or this will cause the game to crash. Type a number instead. I have no idea why, sorry.[or]Remember, don't use a hyperlink or the game will crash.[stopping][roman type][line break]".]

disambiguation-busy is initially false.

A thing has a number called the disambiguation-ID. Understand the disambiguation-ID property as describing a thing when disambiguation-ID-count > 1.

Disambiguation-ID-count is a number that varies.

Before asking which do you mean (this is the Disambiguation Choices need clarification rule):
	now disambiguation-busy is true.

After asking which do you mean (this is the Disambiguation Choices no longer need clarification rule):
	now disambiguation-busy is false.

Every turn:
	if disambiguation-ID-count > 1:
		now disambiguation-ID-count is 1;
		repeat with T running through things:
			now the disambiguation-ID of T is 0.
