	if playerRegion is School, say "That would be a waste of time. [big he of the noun] would just mess [himself of the noun] again almost instantly." instead;
	if the player is immobile or the player is in danger, say "You're a bit busy." instead;
	if the player is not able to use manual dexterity, say "Your limited manual dexterity makes this impractical." instead.
Carry out BabChanging it with:
	allocate 6 seconds;

Eventually [he of the noun][']s all clean and safely padded again.";
	now the refactory-period of the noun is a random number between -100 and 300;
	let SD be a random off-stage soiled-diaper;
	if diaper messing >= 6 and SD is soiled-diaper:
		now SD is carried by the player;
