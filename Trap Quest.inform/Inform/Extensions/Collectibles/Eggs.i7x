Eggs by Collectibles begins here.


An egg is a kind of collectible. An egg can be laid. An egg is usually not laid.

Definition: an egg is insertable: decide yes.

To compute toyInsertion of (S - an egg) into (F - asshole):
	let N be 1;
	let continueEgging be 1;
	destroy S;
	while continueEgging is 1:
		let remainingN be the number of small eggs in the location of the player;
		if S is small egg:
			increase remainingN by the number of carried small eggs;
		if S is medium egg:
			now remainingN is the number of medium eggs in the location of the player;
			increase remainingN by the number of carried medium eggs;
		if S is large egg:
			now remainingN is the number of large eggs in the location of the player;
			increase remainingN by the number of carried large eggs;
		now continueEgging is 0;
		if remainingN > 0:
			say "There [if remainingN is 1]is one [ShortDesc of S][otherwise]are [remainingN] [ShortDesc of S]s[end if] left. ";
			if N is 1:
				say "Do you want to push them all in? ";
				if the player is consenting:
					increase N by remainingN;
					now remainingN is 0;
					if S is small egg:
						repeat with E running through carried small eggs:
							destroy E;
						repeat with E running through small eggs in the location of the player:
							destroy E;
					if S is medium egg:
						repeat with E running through carried medium eggs:
							destroy E;
						repeat with E running through medium eggs in the location of the player:
							destroy E;
					if S is large egg:
						repeat with E running through carried large eggs:
							destroy E;
						repeat with E running through large eggs in the location of the player:
							destroy E;
			if remainingN > 0:
				say "Do you want to push another in? ";
				if the player is consenting:
					increase N by 1;
					now continueEgging is 1;
					let E be a random carried small egg;
					if S is small egg:
						if E is not a thing, let E be a random small egg in the location of the player;
					if S is medium egg:
						now E is a random carried medium egg;
						if E is not a thing, now E is a random medium egg in the location of the player;
					if S is large egg:
						now E is a random carried large egg;
						if E is not a thing, now E is a random large egg in the location of the player;
					if E is a thing, destroy E;
					otherwise now continueEgging is 0; [failsafe, should never happen]
	compute insertionRuin of S into F;
	if S is small egg, assfill N small eggs;
	if S is medium egg, assfill N medium eggs;
	if S is large egg, assfill N large eggs.

An egg has a number called hatching.

Check attacking egg:
	if the player is immobile, say "You're a bit busy!" instead;
	allocate 1 seconds;
	say "The shell is too strong! You can't damage it at all. If you want to get rid of it, perhaps you could [bold type]flush it down a toilet[roman type][line break]" instead.
Check slapping egg:
	try attacking the noun instead.
Check kneeing egg:
	try attacking the noun instead.
Check kicking egg:
	try attacking the noun instead.
Check dropping egg:
	if the location of the player is toilets:
		say "Do you mean dropping it down the toilet? ";
		if the player is consenting:
			if the player is immobile, say "You're a bit busy!" instead;
			if the number of carried eggs > 1:
				say "Do you want to flush all your eggs down the toilet? ";
				if the player is consenting:
					repeat with E running through carried eggs:
						unless E is the noun, compute flushing of E;
			compute flushing of the noun instead.

Report examining egg when egg laying fetish is 1:
	say "The strong shell can't be destroy by brute force, but perhaps you could [bold type]drop[roman type] it down the toilet.".

To compute flushing of (E - a thing):
	allocate 2 seconds;
	destroy E;
	say "You flush [NameDesc of E] down the toilet.".

To uniquely destroy (E - an egg):
	now the hatching of E is 0;
	now E is not laid.

A later time based rule:
	if playerRegion is not school:
		repeat with E running through on-stage eggs:
			if E is laid or the hatching of E > 0:
				compute hatchtime of E.

To compute hatchtime of (E - an egg):
	increase the hatching of E by a random number between 1 and 2;
	if E is held or E is in the location of the player:
		if the remainder after dividing the hatching of E by 30 is 0, say "[BigNameDesc of E] shudders[one of]. Is there something alive inside?![or].[stopping]";
	if the hatching of E > 130 and E is regional:
		compute hatch of E.


To compute hatch of (E - an egg):
	let L be a random off-stage larva;
	if L is larva:
		if E is held or E is in the location of the player, say "[BigNameDesc of E] cracks open, and a maggot-like tentacle larva worms its way out.[one of][line break][variable custom style]Gross![roman type][line break][or][stopping]";
		now L is in the location of E;
		larvaShortcutAssign L;
	otherwise:
		if E is held or E is in the location of the player, say "[BigNameDesc of E] fizzles into nothingness.";
	destroy E.

Definition: a small egg (called D) is available:
	if D is off-stage, decide yes;

	if D is off-stage, decide yes;
	repeat with E running through off-stage medium eggs:
		decide no;
	if D is in the location of the player, decide no;
	decide yes.

To decide which number is the crafting key of (E - a medium egg):
	decide on 24.

Definition: a large egg (called D) is available:
	if D is off-stage, decide yes;
	repeat with E running through off-stage large eggs:
		decide no;
	if D is in the location of the player, decide no;
	decide yes.
