To compute condom request choice of (M - a monster):
	if the player is a march 2017 top donator and M is unwrapped and M is intelligent:

	if R < the condom resistance of M, decide no;
	decide yes.

To decide which number is the condom resistance of (M - a monster):
	decide on 0. [Default 100% success]

To compute condom filling of (M - a monster):

You can however bite and drink them - this obviously makes you drink a humiliating dose of [semen], but it also halves the amount that the condom increases the outrage of the item.  Of course, the best solution is probably to eventually remove the piece of clothing when it gets too ridiculous.[roman type][line break][or][stopping]";
	increase the used condoms of C by 1;
	say "[one of]They seem to magically fuse, and you now have a used condom hanging from your [C]!  [or]The condom fuses to your [C] just like before.  [or]The condom fuses to your [C].  [stopping]";
