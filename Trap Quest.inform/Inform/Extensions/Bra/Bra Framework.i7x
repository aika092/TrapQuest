Bra Framework by Bra begins here.

A bra is a kind of clothing. bras have a number called support. The support of a bra is usually 1. bras have a number called size. bras have a number called min size. The min size of a bra is usually 2. bras have a number called max size. The max size of a bra is usually 15. A bra is usually top-displacable. The soak-limit of a bra is usually 10.

To decide which number is the current support of (B - a bra):
	let S be 0;
	if B is top-placed and B is worn:
		if the largeness of breasts + 2 > the size of B, increase S by the support of B;
		increase S by the magic-modifier of B;
	decide on S.

A bra is usually rare.

Definition: a bra is same-type if theme-share-target is bra and theme-share-target is not bikini top.

Definition: a bra is ingredient if it is not product.

To decide which number is the crafting key of (B - a bra):
	decide on 26.

A bra is usually average cut. A bra is usually normally-nipple-covering.

The printed name of bra is usually "[clothing-title-before][CupDesc of item described][ShortDesc of item described][clothing-title-after]". The printed plural name of bra is usually "[clothing-title-before][CupDesc of item described][ShortDesc of item described]s[clothing-title-after]".

To say ShortDesc of (B - a bra):
	say "bra".
To say MediumDesc of (B - a bra):
	say selfexaminetitle of B.

To say CupDesc of (B - a bra):
	let S be the size of B;
	if diaper quest is 0, say "[BraSize S] cup ".

To compute SelfExamineDesc of (B - a bra):
	let X be the largeness of breasts;
	let B be a random bra worn by the player;
	let Y be the size of B;
	if X < 3 or diaper quest is 1:
		say " that are inside a [selfexaminetitle of B]. ";
	otherwise:
		if Y > X + 2:
			say " that hang freely inside the cups of your [selfexaminetitle of B]. ";
		otherwise if Y > X and Y < X + 3:
			say " that sit loosely inside the cups of your [selfexaminetitle of B]. ";
		otherwise if Y is X:
			say " that sit perfectly inside the cups of your [selfexaminetitle of B]. ";
		otherwise if Y < X and Y > X - 2:
			say " that fit tightly inside the cups of your [selfexaminetitle of B]. ";
		otherwise if Y < X - 1:
			say " that are overflowing out of the cups of your [selfexaminetitle of B]. ".

Report examining bra:
	let S be the current support of the noun;
	if the largeness of breasts > 1:
		if S > 0:
			say "This [ShortDesc of the noun] is [if S > 2]significantly[otherwise if S is 2]moderately[otherwise]slightly[end if] supporting your breasts.";
		otherwise if the noun is worn:
			say "This [ShortDesc of the noun] is not supporting your breasts[if the largeness of breasts + 2 <= the size of the noun and the support of the noun > 0] because the cups are too big[otherwise if the noun is not top-placed and the support of the noun > 0] because it has been displaced[end if].";
	if the largeness of breasts > 2 and newbie tips is 1, say "[if the current support of the noun > 0]Bras[otherwise if the noun is top-placed]Most bras (but not this one)[otherwise]Most bras (but not when displaced)[end if] [if the number of worn bras is 0]would [end if]reduce the effective weight of your breasts and the amount that your slap damage [if the largeness of breasts >= 6 and the breastskill of the player is 0]is[otherwise]would be[end if] reduced by having large breasts[if the breastskill of the player is 1] if you hadn't learned the skill from the gladiator[end if].".

To say selfexaminetitle of (B - a bra):
	say ShortDesc of B.

To decide which number is the initial outrage of (C - a bra):
	decide on 0.

To compute unique summoning of (C - a bra):
	if the largeness of breasts >= the min size of C and the largeness of breasts <= the max size of C, now the size of C is the largeness of breasts.

To decide which object is the unique-upgrade-target of (C - a bra):
	if there is a worn demonic wearthing and tongue-bra is off-stage, decide on tongue-panties;
	if diaper quest is 1, decide on a random off-stage training bra;
	decide on nothing.

To decide what number is the original price of (C - a bra):
	decide on 3.

To Set Up Bras:
	repeat with B running through bras:
		unless B is immune to change:
			Set up B.

To set up influence of (C - a bra):
	set up random-based influence of C.

To uniquely set up (B - a bra):
	Assign size to B;
	if diaper quest is 0:
		if extreme proportions fetish is 0 and the size of B > 11 - max breast size points, now the size of B is a random number between 3 and (11 - max breast size points);
		if extreme proportions fetish is 1 and the size of B > 20 - max breast size points, now the size of B is a random number between 10 and (20 - max breast size points);
	if the size of B < the min size of B, now the size of B is min size of B;
	let R be a random number between 1 and 9;
	if R is 1, now B is suppression;
	if R is 2:
		now B is absorption;
		if diaper quest is 1, now B is maturity;
	if R is 3:
		now B is temptation;
		if diaper quest is 1, now B is respiration;
	if R is 4 and lactation fetish is 1, now B is milk production;
	if R > 6 and B is fully exposing, now B is protection;
	if R is 3 or R is 4, curse B;

To Assign Size to (B - a bra):
	if diaper quest is 1, now the size of B is 5;
	otherwise now the size of B is a random number between min size of B and max size of B.

To compute found size of (B - a bra):
	if the max size of B >= 20:
		now the size of B is 20;
	otherwise:
		if the size of B < the largeness of breasts + 2, now the size of B is the largeness of breasts + (a random number between 0 and 2); [We want it to be at least big enough for the player to wear right now]
		if the size of B > max breast size and max breast size >= min size of B, now the size of B is max breast size; [No point having it larger than max breast size]
		if the size of B > the max size of B, now the size of B is the max size of B. [Can't be larger than its limit]

Report going: [Let's make sure that all bras are a sensible size when encountered in containers.]
	repeat with C running through containers in the location of the player:
		repeat with B running through bras in C:
			compute found size of B;
	if the player is in School06: [Room below junk room]
		repeat with B running through bras in School15: [Junk room]
			compute found size of B.

To compute bra strain:
	repeat with B running through worn bras:
		if the size of B + the leniency of B < the largeness of breasts:
			compute bra strain of B.

To compute bra strain of (B - a bra):
	if the size of B < the max size of B and B is blessed:
		say "Your [ShortDesc of B] grows with your [BreastDesc] to continue to contain them.";
		increase the size of B by 1;
	otherwise:
		BraBurst B.

To BraBurst (B - a bra):
	say "Your [printed name of B] can't take the strain any more, and the clasp at the back snaps. It pings off your body, ruined!";
	destroy B.

To decide which number is the leniency of (B - a bra): [the higher F the bigger boobs need to get to burst clothing]
	let F be 4;
	repeat with C running through worn clothing:
		increase F by the leniency-addition of C;
	decide on F.

To restock (C - a bra):
	let B be a random basic loot bra;
	if B is bra, now B is in Standard Item Pen.

This is the setup starting bras rule:
	let C be a random bra;
	repeat with N running from 1 to 1:
		restock C.
The setup starting bras rule is listed in the setup starting items rules.

To say BraSize (X - a number):
	if X is 2, say "AA";
	if X is 3, say "A";
	if X is 4, say "B";
	if X is 5, say "C";
	if X is 6, say "D";
	if X is 7, say "DD";
	if X is 8, say "E";
	if X is 9, say "F";
