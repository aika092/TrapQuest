Camera Trap by Traps begins here.

A camera trap is a kind of trap. There are 10 potentially sticky camera traps.

To say ExamineDesc of (C - a camera trap):
	say "A modern looking camera is embedded in a wall at ankle height. It is pointing upwards and looks like it could take some extremely high resolution images.".

This is the spawn initial hotel camera traps rule:
	repeat with N running from 1 to 8:
		let R be a random trappable placed modern room;
		while there is a camera trap in R:
			now R is a random trappable placed modern room;
		let T be a random off-stage camera trap;
		deploy T in R;
		if N > 4, now T is triggerless.
The spawn initial hotel camera traps rule is listed last in the set up hotel traps rules.

[!<CameraTrap>@<SayEnvironmentDesc>+

This is what is put in the room description when the trap is visible (revealed).

+@!]
To say EnvironmentDesc of (T - a camera trap):
	say "A camera is embedded in one wall, quite low down to get a compromising angle when it takes a photo. ".

To say ShortDesc of (T - a camera trap):

To trigger (Y - a camera trap):
	let P be a random off-stage upskirt poster;
	if ((the number of worn trousers is 0 and the number of worn skirted clothing > 0) or asshole is lewdly exposed or the flesh volume of hips > 5) and P is poster:
		say FlashFlav of Y;

		set up P;
	otherwise:
		say "You hear a weird whirring, a bit like an old camera film being wound forwards, but nothing else happens.".

To say FlashFlav of (Y - a camera trap):
	say "[bold type]FLASH![roman type][line break]A bright flash like lightning envelops the room for a brief moment. [if Y is revealed and the reset-timer of Y < 99000]You had forgotten about that stupid camera!

	now Y is revealed;
	now the reset-timer of Y is 99999.

To say ExpulsionFlashFlav of (Y - a camera trap):

A poster is a kind of thing. A poster is not portable. The printed name of a poster is "[TQlink of item described][if item described is in the hotel]banner[otherwise]poster[end if][TQxlink of item described]". The text-shortcut of a poster is "po".
A poster can be unspotted or spotted. A poster is usually unspotted. [Has the player seen it before?]
A poster can be identifiable or unidentifiable. A poster is usually identifiable. [Can the player be identified from the poster?]
Understand "banner" as poster. Understand "new" as a poster when the item described is unspotted and the item described is on-stage. [For debugging purposes]

Figure of poster is the file "Env/Multifloor/poster1.png".
Figure of banner is the file "Env/Hotel/banner1.png".

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - a poster):
	if C is in the hotel, decide on figure of banner;
