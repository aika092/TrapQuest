Glue Trap by Traps begins here.


[Glue can be applied to clothing or (maybe) applied to certain objects like dildos?
 Maybe foes will later decide to do stuff like pull a hand free and stick it to your hip so they walk more like a sissy?
The stickiness of the player now acts as a simple counter, being reduced by various effects.
Stickiness starts as 3 + a random number between 1 and glue-strength / 4.
Strength is used to pull free: but if you pull free with too much strength, you can fall and get re-stuck - maybe worse.
 One day there might be one special glue trap that's a chair/bench with just a seat, back, and legs: i.e. the butt/groin poke through the back.
 "times-stuck": Count of how many times the player has been stuck. Previously used to make it easier to escape by dividing the target for escaping. That made it much too easier, after balancing for the 1st-time case. So now, it's just used to tell if you've just fallen. Hmm. Or maybe that's a kludge that only works the 1st time... ### Yeah. I think I'd need to use is as "already-stuck" and zero it when they escape. Seems a bit clumsy.

glu-colour is a kind of value. The glu-colours are pinkish, yellowish, blackish, whiteish.

[Limit how many glue traps, you want, in total, here. 3 means at most 1 in dungeon, at most 1 in hotel, the rest in the jungle: provided that code isn't commented out.]
A glue is a kind of thing. There are 3 glues. A glue has a number called glue-strength. A glue has a glu-colour called the active-colour. A glue has a number called smell-duration. A glue has a number called times-stuck. Understand the active-colour property as describing a glue. The active-colour of a glue is normally pinkish. The glue-strength of a glue is normally 14. The smell-duration of a glue is normally 4. [4 rounds]  A glue can be full-strength or weakened. The printed name of glue is "[TQlink of item described]puddle of glue[shortcut-desc][TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]". The text-shortcut of glue is "glu". Understand "glu", "sticky", "blob", "adhesive" as glue. A glue is not portable.

Figure of Glue Cutscene 1 is the file "Special/Cutscene/cutscene-glue1.jpg".
Figure of Glue Cutscene 2 is the file "Special/Cutscene/cutscene-glue2.jpg".
Figure of Glue Trap is the file "Env/MultiFloor/glue1.jpg".
Figure of Glue Pool is the file "Env/MultiFloor/glue2.jpg".

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (G - a glue):
	if G is not grabbing the player, decide on figure of glue pool;
	if the stickiness of the player < 3, decide on Figure of Glue Cutscene 2;
	decide on Figure of Glue Cutscene 1.

Definition: a glue is TQedible: decide yes.

Carry out TQeating glue:
	say "You decide that would be a bad idea." instead.

To say ExamineDesc of (G - a glue):
	say "A [if G is full-strength][one of]faintly glowing[or]luminous[stopping] shiny [active-colour of g] patch of sticky exudate[otherwise]thick layer of rubbery-looking [active-colour of G] ooze. It looks like a cross between melted silly-putty and the coating they put on flypaper[end if].".

To say MediumDesc of (G - a glue):
	say "pool of [the active-colour of G] [if the glue is not full-strength]once-[otherwise]mildly [end if]sticky glue".

To say ShortDesc of (G - a glue):
	say "[the active-colour of G] glue".

Understand the glue-strength property as describing a glue.

Tearing off is an action applying to one thing.

[They can rub clothing in glue to soak up glue and weaken the bond. But if they later wear it, it will get stuck!]

A glue trap is a kind of trap. A glue trap can be industrial or organic. A glue trap is usually organic. There are 4 potentially click glue traps.

Is there a puddle of glue grabbing the player?  Selkie is unsure if this is redundant, given that a non-zero stickiness should indicate this.

[Glue trip checking is done when the trap 1st activates, AND when the player tries to struggle free (because while struggling, they can get worse stuck).
The check to see if the player gets stuck depends on their dexterity, modified by how overloaded they are and how well-balanced on their heels they are. If it pulls them off-balance and sticks them, then further mutation effects kick in.
There is a chance they fall so badly they can get more stuck, too, but this is much reduced compared to the chance of falling at first. ]

 This has no text output if consequences is false, and just breaks the player free of the glue no questions asked.
 For use in various situations - even e.g. when teleporting (which should cause some damage).
 I tried defining this as "raw glue escape (G - a glue) with (consequences - a truth state)" but then could find absolutely no way to pass a literal truth value.

 Glue escaping is more a matter of brute strength. maybe consider using the check glue tripping function instead of the special code here. It is the glue grabbing the player, not the glue trap?
 The check is vs the glue-strength, not the stickiness, unless they've reduced stickiness to 0 somehow; in which case, this function turns off the glue grabbing, too.
 If they do escape, this will do the "try standing" for the player, too.

Check tearing off:
	if the noun is not worn glued clothing, say "That's not [if the noun is not clothing]something you can tear off[otherwise if the noun is not worn]worn[otherwise]glued[end if]." instead;
	if gluePainThreshold > 0, say "Ow, ow, ow! It hurts too much, the pain is bringing tears to your eyes! You'll have to wait a bit longer before trying this again." instead.

Carry out tearing off worn clothing:
	let C be the noun;
	allocate 3 seconds;
	say "You start tugging at the [C]...";
	if the dexterity of the player > a random number between 1 and 30:
		[Simulate pulling it free a bit by probability]
		if a random number between 1 and 4 is 1:
			say "Finally! You managed to carefully tear the [ShortDesc of C] free.";
			now C is not glued;
			now glueTries is 0;
		otherwise:
			say "You get more of it free before the pain gets too much. You should keep trying a bit later!";
			now gluePainThreshold is the delicateness of the player + 1;
			increase glueTries by 1;
	otherwise:
		say "Ouch! That hurts, and it's tearing the [ShortDesc of C]. Are you sure you want to continue ripping it off by brute strength? ";
		if the player is consenting:
			say "Ouch! That really hurt!";
			PainUp 1;
			if C is not rigid:
				if C is crotch-intact or C is crotch-zipped or C is crotch-skirted:
					say "Oh... and the glue had adhered so strongly you hear a tearing sound...";
					if C is rippable:
						rip C;
						say "You have accidentally managed to create a hole at the crotch of your [C]!";
					otherwise:
						say "You damage the [C].";
						damage C;
			if glueTries > 2 or a random number between 1 and 5 <= glueTries:
				say "But yes! You managed to carefully tear the [ShortDesc of C] free.";
				now C is not glued;
				now glueTries is 0;
			otherwise:
				say "You only manage to get a little bit more of it free, and you have really hurt yourself. You decide that you're not going to try again for a little while!";
				now gluePainThreshold is the delicateness of the player + 9;
				increase glueTries by 1;
		otherwise:
			say "Fearing the pain, you stop.".

Check pulling glue:
	if the player is glue stuck, try standing instead.
