This is fucking ridiculous, here you are, stuck in the middle of the [the printed name of the location of the player], held in place by a hook in your [asshole].

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To Jump From The Hook:
	say "You jump up as much as you can while on tip toes, which isn't much, hoping you can get off the hook this way.  But the rope just pulls up as you jump, and now you are even more on tiptoes as before as the rope refuses to return to its original amount of slack!  This is putting even more of your weight on the hook in your [asshole]!  Maybe try [bold type]pull[roman type]ing it instead?";
	now seconds is 6;
	Assruin 1.
