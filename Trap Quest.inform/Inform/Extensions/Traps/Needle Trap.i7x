A needle trap is a kind of trap. There are 4 potentially pressure potentially sticky potentially click potentially wire needle traps.

This is the spawn initial woods needle traps rule:
	repeat with N running from 1 to 4:
		let R be a random trappable placed jungle room;
		let T be a random off-stage needle trap;
		unless there is a needle trap in R, deploy T in R.
The spawn initial woods needle traps rule is listed first in the set up woods traps rules.

[The idea is that if the player is (nearly?) an inflated sex doll, the needles change into suction cup darts that somehow stick on and magically infuse their effect, rather than risking puncturing you.]
To say needle:
	if the latex-transformation of the player > 6, say "suction cup dart";
	otherwise say "needle".

Part - Rune Trap

A rune trap is a kind of trap. A rune trap is potentially pressure. The printed name of a rune trap is "[TQlink of item described]magic rune pressure plate trap[TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]". Understand "magic rune", "pressure", "plate" as a rune trap. The text-shortcut of a rune trap is usually "rt".

To say ExamineDesc of (T - a rune trap):
	say "This paving stone had a magic rune implanted in it, which triggered when you stepped on it. Stepping on it again when it's already in this revealed state doesn't do anything.".

To decide which figure-name is the triggered-image of (T - a rune trap):
	decide on the examine-image of T.

This is the spawn initial dungeon rune traps rule:
	repeat with T running through off-stage fetish appropriate rune traps:
		let failsafe be 50;
		while failsafe > 0:
			decrease failsafe by 1;
			let R be a random trappable placed labyrinth room;
			unless there is a rune trap in R or there is a pressure trap in R, deploy T in R.
The spawn initial dungeon rune traps rule is listed first in the set up dungeon traps rules.

To trigger (Y - a rune trap):
	now the player-motion of the player is 0;
	now the reset-timer of Y is 650;
	now Y is not untriggered;
	now Y is triggered;
	now Y is revealed;
	cutshow the triggered-image of Y for Y;
	say "A magic rune appears on the stone slab! ";
	compute unique trigger of Y;
	compute trap reaction of Y.

To compute trap reaction of (Y - a rune trap):
	repeat with M running through reactive monsters:
		say RuneTrapReactFlav of M.

To compute unique trigger of (Y - a rune trap):
	say "But nothing happens. Weird! This must be a buggy trap.".

To say RuneTrapReactFlav of (M - a monster):
	say TriggeredTrapReactFlav of M.
