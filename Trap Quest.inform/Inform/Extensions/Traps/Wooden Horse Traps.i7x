Section 1 Painted Horse Trap

A painted horse is a kind of wooden horse. There are 3 potentially pressure potentially sticky painted horses. Understand "button", "buttons" as painted horse.
To say ExamineDesc of (C - a painted horse):
	say "A large block of triangular wood that ends in a thin point at the top. A carved block of wood sits at the front, painted to make it resemble an actual horse. On top of the horse's head are 5 buttons. [5 - the number of entries in list of possible horse effects] buttons have already been pressed.".


Check pushing painted horse:
	try HorsePressing the noun instead;

HorsePressing is an action applying to one thing.
Check HorsePressing:
	if the noun is not painted horse, say "There aren't any buttons to press on that." instead;
	if the noun is not penetrating asshole, say "But you aren't on it any more!" instead;
Carry Out HorsePressing:
	allocate 3 seconds;
	let R be the number of entries in list of possible horse effects;
	let B be nothing;
	if R > 0:
		now R is a random number between 1 and R;
		now B is entry R of list of possible horse effects;

	otherwise if B is horse-cuffs:
		if the silicone volume of breasts > 0 and fake-nails is actually summonable:
			say "Huge pink fake nails appear on each of your fingers! You are immediately filled with a horrible sense of dread; almost all you can think about is [if the player is horny]how horny you are and [end if]how awful, and painful, it would be if any of your nails were to break. The invasive thought is so powerful that you also feel significantly weaker and slower as your mind makes you think twice about every action you take.";
			summon fake-nails cursed;
		otherwise if the player is not wrist bound and the class of the player is not living sex doll:
			say "Leather cuffs appear around your wrists! [if the bimbo of the player > 13][line break][second custom style]Ooh, how kinky.[otherwise][line break][variable custom style]Fuck...[end if][roman type][line break]";
			let W be a random off-stage pair of wristcuffs;
			if W is nothing, now W is a random off-stage wrist bond;
			if W is clothing:
				summon W locked;
				now W is wrist-bound-in-front;
		otherwise:
			say "Nothing seems to happen."; [TODO think of something to do here]
	otherwise if B is horse-blade:
		say "Blades shoot out of the sides of the wooden horse and up either side of you with perfect precision, right next to your hips.";
		let slice-count be 0;
		repeat with C running through worn clothing:
			if C is knickers or C is skirt or C is overdress or C is trousers or C is suspenders:
				unless C is overdress and C is not crotch covering:
					say "Your [printed name of C] is ripped and destroyed!";
					destroy C;
					increase slice-count by 1;
		if the slice-count is 0, say "If there was any clothing covering your hips, it would probably have been destroyed.";
	otherwise if B is horse-hair:
		say "You let out an involuntary horse whinny. [line break][variable custom style]Well that was weird...[roman type][line break]";
		HairUp 4;
	otherwise if B is horse-disable or R is 0:
		now the noun is not penetrating vagina;
		now the noun is not penetrating asshole;
		now the noun is triggered;
		say "The horse [if horse-vibrations is listed in the list of current horse effects]stops vibrating and [end if]gracefully descends until you can stand and walk away.".

Understand "press [something]", "push button on [something]", "press button on [something]", "pr [something]" as HorsePressing.


The horse-vibrations, the horse-alarm, the horse-disable, the horse-cuffs, the horse-blade and the horse-hair are things.
