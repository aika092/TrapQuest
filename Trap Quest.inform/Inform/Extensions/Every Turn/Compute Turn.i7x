Compute Turn by Every Turn begins here.

[!<anotherTurn:Integer>*

When this is set to 1, we are flagging that we want the game to compute another turn after this one. Usually because the player isn't allowed to act this turn.

*!]
another-turn is a number that varies. [if set to 1, we get another turn]
another-turn-flavour is a text that varies. [if we have another turn, we can optionally also set flavour to say just as the new turn begins]
This is the no-stored-action rule:
	continue the action.
another-turn-rules is a list of rules that varies. [if we have another turn, is there a rule we should follow instead of the player's action]
another-turn-action is a rule that varies. another-turn-action is the no-stored-action rule. [if we have another turn, is there a rule we should follow as an automatic action]
time-turns is a number that varies. [just lets us count how many turns have passed]

The compulsory action rules is a rulebook. [Things that MUST happen like continued urination and expulsion]

Oh, so this is how time works! So "seconds" represents how many seconds of the current round has elapsed. And if seconds is 0, the round hasn't really started, so monsters and background activities don't progress.
### But the "run the engine" function seems bizarre to Selkie, looking equivalent to just writing:
### The another-turn flag can be set to 1 for various reasons, which causes the "engine" to run again without giving the player a chance to act. The player can only have a turn if another-turn is STILL 0 at the end of the turn

We save the local seconds value to a global integer right before we follow the 'time based' rules. This way we make sure that each time the time based rules is called, we are using a unique pair of seconds and earnings.

Otherwise, imagine if we had a 'compute extra turn' called before we got to the time based rules. We would have seconds & earnings reduced twice and then the time based rules followed twice - with the same seconds and earnings pair both times. This could allow for periodic effects like hunger increasing to either be skipped or even worse triggered twice in a row.
