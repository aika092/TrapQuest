To compute suggestion:
	decrease suggested by 1;
	[here we do whatever we need to determine if we're meeting the suggestions, assuming we didn't build that in elsewhere]
	if suggested < 0 and suggestion-type is not 0 and suggestion-tracking is 0:
		[consequences get decided here]
		say "You suddenly have a splitting headache!";
		if suggestion-type is 1:
			say "It feels like a small portion of your brain is now stuck in a loop of visions of yourself sucking cocks!";
			OralSexAddictUp 1;
		otherwise if suggestion-type is 2:
			say "It feels like a small portion of your brain is now stuck in a loop of visions of yourself taking it in the ass!";
			AnalSexAddictUp 1;
		otherwise if suggestion-type is 3:
			say "It feels like a small portion of your brain is now stuck in a loop of visions of yourself getting fucked!";
			VaginalSexAddictUp 1;
		otherwise if suggestion-type is 4:
			say "It feels like a small portion of your brain is now stuck in a loop of visions of yourself giving titfucks!";
			TitfuckAddictUp 1;
		otherwise:
			say "For some reason you feel very distracted and flirty!";
			Intdown 1;
		[###Selkie: I'd add:
		- one that dropped you to your knees without thinking, - "submit"
		- one that made you strip off all your clothes without thinking, - "stripper"
		- one that made you pull out any bondage gear in your bag of holding and wear them - "slave"
		- one that made you change into more slutty clothes if you have any? - "slutty"
		]
	otherwise if suggestion-tracking is 1:
		[success gets 'rewarded' here]
		say "You feel a sudden sense of relief, as though you had done something very important.";
		now suggestion-type is 0.


The hypno triggers rules is a rulebook.

This is the great ones hypno rule:
	if hypno-trigger is "great one" and player-hypno-great is 1:
		say "Just thinking about the [great one]s makes you feel how powerless you are in comparison to them!";
		humiliate 20.

This is the present-for-oral hypno rule:
	if hypno-trigger is "tasty" and hypno-trigger-tasty is 1 and diaper quest is 0:
		say "[bold type]Having heard the word 'tasty', you find yourself automatically [if face is actually occupied]trying to present[otherwise]presenting[end if] your mouth for use.[roman type][line break]";
		if the player is upright, try silently kneeling;
		let M be a random interested monster in the location of the player;
		if M is nothing:
			now M is a random monster in the location of the player;
			if M is monster, now M is interested;
		if the player is prone:
			if face is actually occupied:
				say "[if the bimbo of the player > 14]Unfortunately[otherwise]Fortunately[end if], your mouth is already occupied.";
			otherwise if M is nothing:
				say "All that happens is that you feel a little silly, since there's nobody here to offer a blowjob to.";
			otherwise:
				try direct-presenting face to M;
				now broken-present-cooldown is 120;
		now another-turn is 1.

		if the number of held food > 0 and face is not actually occupied and the player is able to eat:
			say "[bold type]Having heard the word 'tasty', you find yourself automatically start eating everything you can.[roman type][line break]";
			now auto is 1;
			repeat with F running through held food:
				try TQeating F;
			now auto is 0;
			now another-turn is 1.

This is the autopush hypno rule:

		say "[bold type]Having heard the word 'maturity', you find yourself automatically start [if the player is upright]squatting, [end if]grunting and pushing.[roman type][line break]";
		now player-squatting is 1;
		unless there is a royal guard in the location of the player or there is a gladiator in the location of the player, now diaper-scene-unhandled is 1;
