A time based rule (this is the compute cum movements rule):

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsBellyStrainBalance>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is belly strain balance: [tweak this number to balance this mechanic]
	if there is a rejuvenation clothing penetrating asshole, decide on 60;[rejuvenation dildos suck unless they help you handle enemas in some way, but I'm not certain how to implement "enema-helping" on only the rejuvenation clothing, especially when magical enchantments can sometimes change. Maybe it needs to be a definition instead?]
	decide on 20.
