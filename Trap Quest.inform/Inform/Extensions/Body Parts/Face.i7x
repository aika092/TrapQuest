Face by Body Parts begins here.

Part 1 - Definitions

face is an orifice. Face is everywhere. The printed name of face is "[if item described is occupied]mouth[otherwise]face[end if]". Understand "mouth", "blowjob", "oral", "oral sex", "fellatio", "cunnilingus", "blow job" as face. [This way 'offer/suggest blowjob/etc. is understood by the game] The text-shortcut of face is "face".
To say FullExamineDesc of (B - face):
	say "[ImageDesc of face][TotalDesc of face]".

Face has a number called previous make-up.
Face has a number called previous hair length.
Face has a number called previous hair redness.
Face has a number called previous hair brightness.
Face has a number called previous hair blondeness.
Face has a number called make-up. [Min 0 Max 3 - A high number means slutty makeup.]
Face has a number called lips.

drink-origin is a kind of value. The drink-origins are boring-origin, vaginal-origin, anal-origin.
Face has a drink-origin. Understand the drink-origin property as describing face. Face is boring-origin.

Face has a number called semen volume.
Face has a number called urine volume.
Face has a number called milk volume.
To decide which number is the total volume of face:
	decide on the semen volume of face + the urine volume of face + the milk volume of face.
To decide which number is face-limit:
	decide on 4.
To decide which object is mouthful-liquid:
	let L be water;
	if the semen volume of face > 0, now L is semen;
	if the urine volume of face > 0:
		if L is water, now L is urine;
		otherwise now L is murkwater;
	if the milk volume of face > 0:
		if L is water, now L is milk;
		otherwise now L is murkwater;
	decide on L.

[Can it be accessed right now with nothing blocking it?]
Definition: face is undefended:
	if face is not actually occupied, decide yes;
	decide no.

the face presentable rules is a rulebook.
the presentable rules of face is usually the face presentable rules.

This is the face occupied rule:
	if the player is mouthblocked:
		if auto is 0, say "Your mouth is a bit full already, don't you think?";
		rule fails.
The face occupied rule is listed in the face presentable rules.

This is the too horny to present face rule:
	if diaper quest is 0 and the orifice soreness of the player < 7 and the analvirgin of the player is 0 and the player is horny and (the vaginalvirgin of the player is 0 or the player is not possessing a vagina): [This way females can always present mouth to avoid virginity loss, and all players can present mouth to avoid anal virginity loss]
		if auto is 0 or there is an actually presentable fuckhole: [The automatic action rule does not care if you are horny, unless a fuckhole is actually presentable as well.]
			if the player is very horny:
				if auto is 0, say "You are too aroused and your [if the player is not possessing a vagina][asshole] is[otherwise][vagina] and [asshole] are[end if] begging to be fucked; you can't bring yourself to do that!";
				rule fails.
The too horny to present face rule is listed in the face presentable rules.

This is the monster doesn't do oral rule:
	if diaper quest is 0 and auto > 0 and ((presenting-receiver is monster and presenting-receiver is not willing to do oral) or the number of willing to do oral monsters in the location of the player is 0), rule fails.
The monster doesn't do oral rule is listed in the face presentable rules.

Definition: face is usable without penetration:
	if current-monster is requiring facial penetration, decide no;
	decide yes.

Definition: a monster is requiring facial penetration: decide yes.

[necessary for determining outrage when cumsoaked]
Definition: face is lewdly exposed:
	if it is exposed, decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide which object is the concealer of (T - face):
	decide on a random worn actually dense hood.

To decide which object is the at least partial concealer of (F - face):
	if face is listed in the armUses of arms, decide on arms;
	let H be a random worn not-see-through eye-mask;
	if H is a thing, decide on H;
	if there is a worn not-see-through hood, decide on a random worn not-see-through hood;
	if cultist veil is worn, decide on cultist veil;
	if floral bridal veil is worn and the ceremony of betrothal-quest is false, decide on floral bridal veil;
	decide on nothing.

To decide which number is the lewdly exposed outrage of (F - face):
	if diaper quest is 1 and the make-up of face >= 3, decide on 2;
	let O be the make-up of face;
	increase O by the lips of face;
	increase O by alcohol-level;
	decide on O.

To decide which number is the cringe of (F - face):
	let O be alcohol-level * 2;
	if F is exposed:
		if the make-up of face >= 3, increase O by 4;
	decide on O.

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsTheDesireOfFace>+

How much does the player want this body part to be used?

+!]
To decide which number is the desire of (B - face):
	decide on the oral sex addiction of the player.

This is the plushlip blowjob slut rule:
	increase the desirability of face by 2 * the lips of face.
The plushlip blowjob slut rule is listed in the blowjob slut eligibility rules.

To decide which number is tasteAddictionInterval:
	decide on 12.
To decide which number is tasteAddictionFlatInterval:
	if the player is in an unbossed predicament room, decide on 0;
	decide on 20.

An all time based rule (this is the player gets used to the taste rule):
	if the urine volume of face > 0:
		let A be tasteAddictionFlatInterval + (the urine taste addiction of the player * tasteAddictionInterval);
		if the remainder after dividing time-earnings by A < time-seconds:
			compute slightly addictive tasting of urine;
