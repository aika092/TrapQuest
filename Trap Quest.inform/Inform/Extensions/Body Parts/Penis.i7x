Section 2 - Erections

penis has a number called penis-obedience. The penis-obedience of penis is 1.

To PenisObedienceUp (X - a number):
	while X > 0:
		if the penis-obedience of penis is 10:
			now X is 0;
		otherwise:
			increase the penis-obedience of penis by 1;

					say "[first custom style][one of]I guess sex can still feel good if you're not in control. It's not like it's required or anything.[or]Normally, I like to do the fucking, so just laying back for a change is pretty refreshing.[or]I don't really need to be on top ALL the time. It's fine to let someone else have a turn.[in random order][roman type][line break]";
				otherwise if the penis-obedience of penis < 7:[player decides they prefer not to be doing the fucking]
					say "[variable custom style][one of]If you think about it, my penis isn't really for my pleasure anyway.[or]Honestly, being on top is kind of overrated.[or]I don't mind not being on top. After all, I'm lucky I get to have sex at all.[in random order][roman type][line break]";
				otherwise if the penis-obedience of penis < 10:[orgasms are overrated.]
					say "[variable custom style][one of]I go soft after just one orgasm, so why even have one? After all, my only job is to stay hard for my partner.[or]Ejaculating is just a bonus. The important thing is if your penis can make someone *else* cum.[or]I've always thought [semen] made a huge mess. It's so much more convenient if I don't cum at all.[in random order][roman type][line break]";
				otherwise:[10(max)]
					say "[variable custom style][one of]My penis is for pleasure, but not my pleasure. It's just a toy to be used.[or]My penis was always a toy to be used. All I realised was that it's meant to be used by someone else.[in random order][roman type][line break]";
		decrease X by 1.

[Whenever an npc abuses your penises, it has a chance of increasing your 'obedience' value.

Normally, your penis has a chance of getting erect when you're aroused, depending on sex addiction and how recent your last orgasm was.
Additionally, you can get erect on command. This is also easier or harder depending on sex addiction and your most recent orgasm.

Your obedience level will inhibit you from getting erect randomly, and make it harder to get erections on command.
Instead, you will only be able to get erect when monsters tell you to get erect.
]

penis can be penis-erect or not penis-erect. penis is not penis-erect.

[Some things prevent the player from getting erections]
Definition: penis is able to get erect:
	if the size of penis is 0, decide no;
	if the player is female, decide no;
	if penis is penis-erect, decide yes;
	if there is a worn chastity cage, decide no;
	if there is a worn restricting research airhancer, decide no;
	if refractoryperiod > 0, decide no;[except in special circumstances, you can't get hard immediately after an orgasm]
	decide yes.

[There is a chance the player will want to get erect, but won't be able to manage. This is a little humiliating, but they should usually be able to try again.]
Definition: penis is erect-at-will:
	if penis is not able to get erect, decide no;
	if the player is extremely horny, decide yes;
	let A be 1;
	if the player is a bit horny, increase A by 1;[You get erect easier if you are horny]
	if the player is horny, increase A by 1;
	if the player is very horny, increase A by 1;
	increase A by the size of penis;[if you're bigger, its easier to get erect]
	let D be 0;
	if the wanktime of the player > 0, decrease D by the wanktime of the player / 5;[if you came recently, its harder to get an erection]
	decrease D by the penis-obedience of penis;[if you haven't been told to get an erection, it may be harder]
	decrease D by the anal sex addiction of the player / 2;[your addiction to anal sex also interferes with your erections]
	let R be a random number between A and D;
	if R < -1, decide no;
	decide yes.

[NPCs can demand the player get an erection (usually for sex). Sometimes the player won't be able to get hard at all, which is a little humiliating, and may earn a different sort of punishment]
Definition: penis is erect-on-request:
	if penis is not able to get erect, decide no;
	if the player is extremely horny, decide yes;
	if the penis-obedience of penis is 10, decide yes;
	let A be 1;
	if the player is horny, increase A by 1;
	if the player is very horny, increase A by 1;
	increase A by the size of penis;
	increase A by the penis-obedience of penis - 1;[now that the player is being asked to get hard, obedience contributes rather than hinders]
	let D be 0;
	if the wanktime of the player > 0, decrease D by the wanktime of the player / 5;
	decrease D by the anal sex addiction of the player / 2;
	let R be a random number between A and D;
	if R < -1, decide no;
	decide yes.


[Whenever the player gains arousal for the turn, they have a chance of getting an erection]
To compute sudden erection chance (X - a number):
	if penis is penis-erect or penis is not able to get erect or the penis-obedience of penis is 10:
		do nothing;
	otherwise:
		let M be 1;
		if the player is a bit horny, increase M by 1;
		if the player is horny, increase M by 1;
		if the player is very horny, increase M by 1;
		decrease M by the anal sex addiction of the player / 3;
		decrease M by (the penis-obedience of penis - 1) / 3;
		if the wanktime of the player > 0, decrease M by the wanktime of the player / 5;
		now X is X / 100;
		let A be X * M;
		let R be a random number between 1 and A;
		if debuginfo > 1, say "[input-style]Erection chance: [if the player is extremely horny]Automatic; extremely horny[otherwise if X > 10]Automatic; arousal gain over 1000[otherwise]([M]) * arousal factor ([X]) = [A]; d[A] = ([R]) | (150.5) erection threshold[end if][roman type][line break]";

					say "Your feel your [ShortDesc of penis] [harden]ing into an erection[if K3 is clothing], still concealed under your [ShortDesc of K3][end if].".

[Whenever the player cools off from arousal, they will lose their erection]
To compute erection decay:
	if condom of kings is worn and condom of kings is uncursed, do nothing;
	if ghost-strapon is worn and the size of penis < the strap-length of ghost-strapon, do nothing;
	say "[line break][bold type]Your [ShortDesc of penis] softens.[roman type][line break]";
	now penis is not penis-erect.
