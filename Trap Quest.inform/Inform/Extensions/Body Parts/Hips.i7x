hips is a flesh. hips is everywhere. Understand "ass", "butt", "bottom", "rear", "bum", "behind", "rear end", "buttocks", "cheeks" as hips. The text-shortcut of hips is "hips".

To decide which number is the usualHipModesty of (C - a clothing):
	if C is skirt-covering-crotch, decide on 100;
	if C is crotch covering:
		if the armour of C > 0, decide on the armour of C;
		decide on 6; [This is really just a best estimate; but most crotchless outfits e.g. catsuits still cover some butt cheeks. Can obviously be manually overridden.]
	decide on 0.

To decide which number is the hipModesty of (C - an object):
	if C is worn not-butt-windowed clothing, decide on the usualHipModesty of C;
	decide on 0.

To decide which number is the hipModesty of (C - a knickers):
	if C is butt-windowed or C is actually sheer, decide on 0;
	decide on the armour of C.

To decide which number is the hipModesty of (C - a trousers):
	if C is butt-windowed or C is crotch-displaced or C is actually sheer, decide on 0;
	decide on 99.

To decide which number is the hipExposure of (C - an object):
	decide on (7 + (the total volume of hips / 2)) - the hipModesty of C.

To decide which object is the at least partial concealer of (H - hips):
	let O be 0;
	let P be nothing;
	repeat with C running through worn clothing:
		if the hipModesty of C > O:
			now O is the hipModesty of C;
			now P is C;
	decide on P.

To decide which number is the unique outrage of (H - hips):
	let C be the at least partial concealer of H;
