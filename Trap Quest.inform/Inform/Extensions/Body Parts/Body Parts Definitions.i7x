Body Parts Definitions by Body Parts begins here.

[We keep track of major body parts separately as backdrops.]
[The player and the game may want to reference specific body parts of the body. These are defined here.]

[This is the default weight rule:
	now body-part-weight is 1.]

[!<BodyPart>@

REQUIRES COMMENTING

@inherits <Backdrop>

@!]
a body part is a kind of backdrop.

REQUIRES COMMENTING

*@!]
a fuckhole has a number called soreness. The soreness of a fuckhole is usually 0.

[!<Fuckhole>@<tolerated:Integer>*

This value is a running counter of how much punishment a fuckhole has recently taken. If the hole is left alone long enough to recover some soreness, this value resets to 0, but if it is allowed to exceed one half the sex addiction value for this orifice, the player will have to roll to avoid losing some mental stats. See the Orifice Soreness extension by "Player".

*@!]
a fuckhole has a number called tolerated. The tolerated of a fuckhole is usually 0.

[!<Fuckhole>@<openness:Integer>*

REQUIRES COMMENTING

*@!]
