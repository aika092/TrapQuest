Body Parts Definitions by Body Parts begins here.

[We keep track of major body parts separately as backdrops.]
[The player and the game may want to reference specific body parts of the body.  These are defined here.]

[This is the default weight rule:
	now body-part-weight is 1.]

[!<WhichNumberIsTheSemenVolumeOfFuckhole>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is the semen-volume of (F - a fuckhole):
	if F is vagina , decide on the semen volume of vagina;
	if F is asshole, decide on the semen volume of belly;
	decide on 0.

[!<FuckholeIsLewdlyExposed>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
Definition: a fuckhole (called F) is lewdly exposed:
	if F is exposed, decide yes; [Plugs are not usable as modesty items]
	[if F is exposed and F is not actually occupied, decide yes; [Plugs are actually usable as modesty items]]
	decide no.

To decide which number is the lewdly exposed outrage of (F - a fuckhole):
	let O be 11;
	if F is asshole and the semen volume of belly > 0, increase O by 2;
	if F is vagina and the semen volume of vagina > 0, increase O by 2;
	increase O by the openness of F / 5;
	decide on O.

[!<FuckholeIsAtLeastPartiallyLewdlyExposed>+

	if F is at least partially exposed, decide yes; [Plugs are not usable as modesty items]
	[if F is exposed and F is not actually occupied, decide yes; [Plugs are actually usable as modesty items]]
	decide no.

To decide which number is the at least partially lewdly exposed outrage of (F - a fuckhole):
	decide on the lewdly exposed outrage of F - 2.  [allows us to easily tweak this number]

[!<GapeFuckholeTimesNumber>+

Increases the openness of the fuckhole "F". Should be implemented uniquely for each orifice.

@param <Fuckhole>:<F> The fuckhole being gaped

+!]
To gape (F - a fuckhole) times (X - a number):
	do nothing.

[!<RuinFuckhole>+

Calls the RuinFuckhole function with an argument of 1

+!]
To ruin (F - a fuckhole):
	ruin F times 1.

[!<RuinFuckholeTimesNumber>+

@param <Fuckhole>:<F> The fuckhole being ruined
@param <Integer>:<X> The number of times to ruin F


+!]
To ruin (F - a fuckhole) times (X - a number):
	now the previous soreness of F is the soreness of F;
	increase the buildup of F by 1;
	while X > 0:
		decrease X by 1;
		if the soreness of F > 8 and there is a worn cum dump's undergarment, now the soreness of F is 8; [undergarment prevents fainting from soreness]
		if the number of worn for deposit only tattoos is 0 and the player is extremely horny or F is pushed over the edge:
			if F is vagina, vaginally orgasm shamefully;
			otherwise anally orgasm shamefully;
		otherwise if the buildup of F >= 20 and the soreness of F < 10:
			say "Regardless of how insensitive your [variable F] is, there's no way it can take an infinite fucking.  Over time, you feel it getting slowly more and more sore...";
			now the soreness of F is 10;
			now the buildup of F is 0;
		otherwise if the soreness of F is 10 and X is 0 and there is an embodied thing penetrating F and the number of worn for deposit only tattoos is 0:
			check soreness fainting of F;
		RuinRoll F;
		if the previous soreness of F < 10 and the soreness of F is 10 and delayed fainting is 0, say "[RuinedFlav of F]".

[!<HealFuckholeX>+

Reduces the soreness of a fuckhole by a given amount

@param <Fuckhole>:<F> The fuckhole being healed
@param <Integer>:<X> How much the fuckhole should be healed

!]
To heal (F - a fuckhole) times (X - a number):
	now the previous soreness of F is the soreness of F;
	let Y be X;
	while X > 0:
		decrease X by 1;
		if the soreness of F > 0:
			if Y is X - 1:
				say "Your [variable F] feels [if X > 2 and the soreness of F > 2]much [end if]less sore."; [We only say this once.]
				now the tolerated of F is 0;
			decrease the soreness of F by 1.

[A body part has a rule called weight-rule.  body-part-weight is a number that varies.  The weight-rule of body part is usually the default weight rule.]

To decide which number is the cringe of (B - a body part):
	let C be the outrage of B;
	if C < 4, decide on 0;
	decide on C - 3.  [if we haven't redefined it, then a bit less than the outrage should be a good estimate. Being naked is childish but it's not as childish as it is slutty.]
