arms is a limb. arms is everywhere.

To say FullExamineDesc of (B - arms):

[!<Arms>@<fatBurning:Integer>*

REQUIRES COMMENTING

*@!]
arms has a number called fat-burning.

[!<Arms>@<fleshVolume:Integer>*

REQUIRES COMMENTING

*@!]
arms has a number called flesh volume. the flesh volume of arms is 0.

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsTheWeightOfArms>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is the weight of (XXX - arms):

	decide on S.

[!<ReportSlapping>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
Report slapping:
	compute arm fat burning.

To compute arm fat burning:
	if the flesh volume of arms > 0:
		let F be (200 - (exercise theme bonus * 40)) - (the flesh volume of arms * 10);
		let R be (a random number between 20 and F) + a random number between 20 and F;

To change default arm positions:
	reset multiple choice questions; [ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS WHEN MAKING A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION]

ArmDeciding is an action applying to one thing.
Check ArmDeciding:
	if the player is shameless, say "You are too much of an exhibitionist to cover up your body parts with your arms!" instead.
Carry Out ArmDeciding:
	change default arm positions;
	say "Your arms will adjust (if possible) when time moves forward.".
Understand "adjust [arms]" as ArmDeciding.

Arms ends here.
