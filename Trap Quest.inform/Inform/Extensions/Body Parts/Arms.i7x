Arms by Body Parts begins here.

Part 1 - Definitions

arms is a limb. arms is everywhere.

To say FullExamineDesc of (B - arms):
	say "[if weight gain fetish is 1][TotalDesc of arms][otherwise if realisticArms is 0 or (entry 1 of the armUses of arms is arms and entry 2 of the armUses of arms is arms)]There's nothing interesting to note about your arms. [end if][if entry 2 of the armUses of arms is not arms]Your left hand is covering [NameDesc of entry 2 of the armUses of arms]. [end if][if entry 1 of the armUses of arms is not arms]Your right hand is covering [NameDesc of entry 1 of the armUses of arms]. [end if][if realisticArms is 1 and the player is not shameless]You can decide what you cover with your arms using the command [bold type][']adjust arms['][roman type]. [end if][if debuginfo > 0 and the number of entries in the armUses of arms > 2]BUG - too many entries in arm positions: [armUses of arms].[otherwise if debugmode > 0](Arm positions list: [armUses of arms])[line break][end if]".

arms has a number called fat-burning.

arms has a number called flesh volume. the flesh volume of arms is 0.
Understand "finger", "fingers", "hand", "hands", "arm" as arms. The text-shortcut of arms is "arms".

To decide which number is the weight of (XXX - arms):
	let S be the flesh volume of arms;
	if the latex-transformation of the player > 1 and S > 0, now S is 0;
	decide on S.

Report slapping:
	compute arm fat burning.

To compute arm fat burning:
	if the flesh volume of arms > 0:
		let F be (200 - (exercise theme bonus * 40)) - (the flesh volume of arms * 10);
		let R be (a random number between 20 and F) + a random number between 20 and F;
		if debuginfo > 0 and the trophy-mode of fat-trophy is 0, say "[input-style]Arm weight loss check: arm exercise count ([fat-burning of arms].5) | [R] = 2d[F - 19]+19 <= [F] = 200 - ([flesh volume of arms * 10]) arm fat[roman type][line break]";
		if R <= the fat-burning of arms:
			if the trophy-mode of fat-trophy is 0:
				say "Your recent exercise has burned some fat from your arms!";
				if debuginfo > 0, say "[input-style]Exercise result: arm fatness [flesh volume of arms] -> ";
				FatArmsDown 1;
				if debuginfo > 0, say "[flesh volume of arms][roman type][line break]";
			now the fat-burning of arms is 0.

To decide which object is the at least partial concealer of (A - arms):
	decide on a random worn arm covering not-see-through clothing.
To decide which object is the concealer of (A - arms):
	decide on a random worn arm covering actually dense clothing.


Part 2 - Description

To say NameDesc of (C - arms):
	say "your [ShortDesc of arms]".
To say BigNameDesc of (C - arms):
	say "Your [ShortDesc of arms]".

To say ShortDesc of arms:
	say "arm[if entry 1 in the armUses of arms is entry 2 in the armUses of arms]s[end if]".

To say TotalDesc of arms:
	if weight gain fetish is 1 and the latex-transformation of the player < 4:
		say "You have ";
		if the flesh volume of arms > 9:
			say "obese, blubbery arms that constantly shudder and wobble as you move about. ";
		otherwise if the flesh volume of arms > 7:
			say "very fat arms that wobble embarrassingly as you move. ";
		otherwise if the flesh volume of arms > 5:
			say "relatively fat arms[if saved-flat-strength > 10] that hide any muscles you have. [otherwise]. [end if]";
		otherwise if the flesh volume of arms > 3:
			say "[if saved-flat-strength > 20]incredibly muscly[otherwise if saved-flat-strength > 15]very muscly[otherwise if saved-flat-strength > 10]well toned[otherwise if saved-flat-strength > 6]slim[otherwise]very small and weak looking[end if] chubby arms. ";
		otherwise if the flesh volume of arms > 1:
			say "[if saved-flat-strength > 20]incredibly muscly[otherwise if saved-flat-strength > 15]very muscly[otherwise if saved-flat-strength > 10]well toned[otherwise if saved-flat-strength > 6]slim[otherwise]very small and weak looking[end if] and slightly chubby arms. ";

Part 3 - Modify Arms Stats

To FatArmsUp (X - a number):
	while X > 0 and weight gain fetish is 1:
		if the flesh volume of arms < 10, increase the flesh volume of arms by 1;
		decrease X by 1;
		if newbie tips is 1 and the flesh volume of arms > 2, say "[one of][newbie style]Newbie tip: Your arms are getting a bit chubby! That's making you heavier and therefore you'll tire out faster. However, it is fully reversible! Every time you slap an NPC, you'll exercise your arm muscles a bit, and help you lose that fat.[roman type][line break][or][stopping]".

To FatArmsDown (X - a number):
	if heavyweight tattoo is worn and a random number between 0 and X > 0, decrease X by 1;
	while X > 0:
		if the flesh volume of arms > 0, decrease the flesh volume of arms by 1;
		decrease X by 1.

Part 4 - Realistic Hands

arms has a list of objects called temporaryArmUses. [Things the arms have already been used for this turn]
To decide which number is the available arms of the player:
	let A be 2 - the number of entries in the temporaryArmUses of arms;
	if A < 0, decide on 0;
	decide on A.
[This is the arms already in use rule:
	if realisticArms is 1 and the available arms of the player < 2:
		if manual hands attempt is 1, say "Your [if entry 1 in the temporaryArmUses of arms is entry 2 in the temporaryArmUses of arms]arms are[otherwise]arm is[end if] already busy with [NameDesc of entry 1 in the temporaryArmUses of arms]!";
		rule fails.
The arms already in use rule is listed in the hands restriction rules.]
arms has a list of objects called armUses.
arms has a thing called defaultLeftTarget.
arms has a thing called defaultRightTarget.

To decide which number is the wornArmsRequired of (C - a thing):
	decide on 0.
To decide which number is the wornArmsRequired of (C - a clothing):
	if C is wrist locked, decide on 2;
	decide on 0.
To decide which number is the carriedArmsRequired of (C - a thing):
	decide on 0.

To allocate arm use:
	allocate arm use to arms. [The default "we're using our hands but not to interact with anything specific" OR "using our hands on clothing but NOT concealing the clothing"]
To allocate dual arm use:
	allocate dual arm use to arms.
To allocate arm use to (T - a thing):
	if realisticArms is 1:
		if debugmode is 1, say "Player uses 1 arm interacting with [T].";
		add T to the temporaryArmUses of arms;
		update arms.

ArmDeciding is an action applying to one thing.
Check ArmDeciding:
	if current-predicament is team-three-leg-predicament and the player is in a predicament room and the player is not in Predicament20, say "[variable custom style]I can't do that - what if someone took a picture of me?! I'd receive a constant 5000 volts of pain to the most sensitive place in my body![roman type][line break]" instead;
	if the player is shameless and (current-predicament is not vibe-photo-predicament or the player is not in Predicament01), say "You are too much of an exhibitionist to cover up your body parts with your arms!" instead.
Carry Out ArmDeciding:
	change default arm positions;
	say "Your arms will adjust (if possible) when time moves forward.".
Understand "adjust [arms]" as ArmDeciding.

Arms ends here.
