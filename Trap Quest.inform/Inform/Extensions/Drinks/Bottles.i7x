[!<Bottle>@<origin:OriginEnum>*

This variable maybe needs to be renamed, because what it really is checking is whether the liquid has at any point been up the player's ass. If it has, then it gets flagged as monster-origin. The exception is urine; if the urine came from collecting from being pissed on, then it gets flagged as monster-origin. This is mainly for tracking how valuable the liquid is to the witch. ###Selkie suggests: pee-origin-player or pee-origin-monster
