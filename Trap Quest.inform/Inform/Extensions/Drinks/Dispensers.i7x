+!]
To Set Up Dispensers:
	let N be a random number between 1 and 15;
	repeat with D running through all dispensers:
		refill D with N;
		now the doses of D is a random number between 2 + bonus liquid and 8;
		if D is alchemical vat, now the doses of D is 10;
		increase N by 1;
		if N is 16, now N is 1;

	if D is an alchemical vat:
		say "A huge wrought iron vat, resting on the floor between two counters. You can reach into it if you stretch your arm, but it would be pretty challenging to drink from directly. [run paragraph on]";

[The vat is a unique dispenser that periodically refills itself with a new liquid. TODO: make the vat less busted]
An alchemical vat is a kind of dispenser. There is 1 alchemical vat in Mansion19. Understand "murky" as alchemical vat when the doses of the item described > 0.

The printed name of an alchemical vat is usually "[TQlink of item described][if the doses of item described > 0]vat of murky potion[otherwise]empty vat[end if][shortcut-desc][TQxlink of item described]".
 The text-shortcut of an alchemical vat is usually "av".	

Definition: An alchemical vat (called I) is immune to change:
	decide yes.

A time based rule (this is the vat cycling rule):
	if the player is in the Mansion and the remainder after dividing earnings by 995 < seconds:
		let V be a random alchemical vat;
		let N be a random number between 1 and 15;
		refill V with N;
		now the doses of V is 10;
		if the location of the player is Mansion19, say "A small compartment opens in the wall, and a hose snakes out, filling the vat with another serving of potion!";

Report decanting something with alchemical vat:
	let N be a random number between 1 and 15;
	refill the second noun with N.
