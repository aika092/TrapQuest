teacher-hannah is a ruby-teacher.
The lesson-teacher of pledge-lesson is headmistress.

To set up gym lesson of (M - a monster):
	say "[speech style of M]'[one of]Today's lesson takes place on the racetrack[or]You know what time it is[stopping]. Follow me to the gym, little ones!'[roman type][line break]";

Part - Kissing Lesson

kissing-lesson is a lesson. The lesson-teacher of kissing-lesson is teacher-angela. kissing-lesson has a number called lesson-variant.
[A game universe initialisation rule:
	now the lesson-variant of kissing-lesson is a random number between 0 and 1.]

Definition: kissing-lesson is lesson-appropriate:
