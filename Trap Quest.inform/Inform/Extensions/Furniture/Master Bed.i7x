Their bodies become harder and harder to tell apart from one another as their cries slowly lower in pitch, and patches of chalky white flesh begin to peek out between the vigorously flapping wings. The covers suddenly fly off the bed, leaving you totally exposed as a [printed name of V] steps out of the swirling mass of bats, grinning at you as the rest of the flock disperses through a small open window near the ceiling.[line break][speech style of V]'I can practically taste your anticipation, darling.
