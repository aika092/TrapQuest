	if images visible is 1, display figure of milking bench;
	say "A bench you could kneel and rest on.  There are cups that are clearly for milking swollen mammaries.".
Figure of milking bench is the file "milkingbench1.png".

To compute furniture resting on (M - a milking bench):
	let milking-allowed be 0;
	if the number of worn nipple covering clothing is 1:[If there is more than one layer of nipple covering clothing, you have to manually open the flaps.]
		let B be a random worn nipple covering clothing;
		if the player is not nipples exposed:

				if the player consents:
					now milking-allowed is 1;
					say "You expose your nipples before resting on the bench.";
				otherwise:
					say "You decide against exposing your nipples before resting on the bench.";
			unless B is not-top-displacable or the latex-transformation of the player > 7:[optional-top-displacable as well!]
