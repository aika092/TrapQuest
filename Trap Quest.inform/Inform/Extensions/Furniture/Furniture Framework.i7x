[!<computeMonsterDetectionFurniture>+

This function should be run every turn the player is resting on a piece of furniture, so the player has a chance of noticing nearby monsters.

+!]
To compute monster detection:
	if the player is in danger or there is a dangerous nearby monster:
		if the player is in danger:
			let M be a random dangerous monster in the location of the player;
			if the alert of the player is 0:
				if the intelligence of the player < a random number between 5 and the body soreness of the player + 6, say "You are so comfortable that you can't bring yourself to stop resting! ";
				otherwise now the alert of the player is 1;
		otherwise:
			let M be a random nearby dangerous monster;
			if the alert of the player is 0, say "You are so busy resting you don't notice [NameDesc of M] nearby! ";
			if the alert of the player is 1, say "You spot a threatening looking [M] nearby! ".

[!<computeFurnitureResting>+

This function is called whenever the player successfully "enters furniture". Usually, it should forward control directly to the computeNormalRest function

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is going to be resting on

+!]
To compute furniture resting on (F - a furniture):
	compute normal rest of F.

[!<computeNormalRest>+

This function represents the effects of resting. The player loses any build-up of exercise points, has their stance set to kneeling, and the resting and alert flags are both set to 1. The game will first loop the computeFatigueRefresh function until the player is completed refreshed, then loop the computeSorenessRefresh until the player is healed. If alert is set to 1 at any time, resting is interrupted and computeFurnitureAlerting is run. Otherwise, we run FurnitureRestCompletion when the player is no longer tired. In either case, we finish up by running FurnitureRestEnding, which should contain any code that MUST be run when the player "gets out of bed"

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is going to be resting on

+!]
To compute normal rest of (F - a furniture):
	now resting is 1;
	compute fat burning reset;
	now the stance of the player is 1;
	now the alert of the player is 0;
	while the fatigue of the player > 0 and the alert of the player is 0:
		compute fatigue refresh of F;
	while the body soreness of the player > 0 and the alert of the player is 0:
		compute soreness refresh of F;
	if the alert of the player is 1:
		compute alerting of F;
	otherwise:
		compute rest completion of F;
	now resting is 0;
	compute rest ending of F.

[!<computeFurnitureNormalEffect>+

This function runs computeMonsterDetectionFurniture, invokes computeExtraTurn, then calls the uniqueFurnitureNormalEffect function. This should be called once for every passage of time while the player is resting.

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is resting on

+!]
To compute normal effect of (F - a furniture):
	compute extra turn;
	compute monster detection;
	compute unique normal effect of F.

[!<computeUniqueFurnitureNormalEffect>+

This function should be called whenever time passes when the player is resting.

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is resting on

+!]
To compute unique normal effect of (F - a furniture):
	do nothing.

[!<sayFurnitureRestingDesc>+

Describes the player resting on F

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is resting on

+!]
To say RestingDesc of (F - a furniture):
	say "You continue to rest on the [printed name of F].";

[!<computeFurnitureFatigueRefresh>+

Calls sayFurnitureRestingDesc, increments seconds by 4, then calls UniqueFurnitureFatigueEffect

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is resting on

+!]
To compute fatigue refresh of (F - a furniture):
	say RestingDesc of F;
	allocate 4 seconds;
	compute unique fatigue effect of F;
	compute normal effect of F.

[!<computeUniqueFurnitureFatigueEffect>+

By default does nothing

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is resting on

+!]
To compute unique fatigue effect of (F - a furniture):
	do nothing.

[!<computeFurnitureSorenessRefresh>+

Calls sayFurnitureRestingDesc, increments seconds by 6, calls UniqueFurnitureSorenessEffect, then heals the player for 1.

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is resting on

+!]
To compute soreness refresh of (F - a furniture):
	say RestingDesc of F;
	allocate 6 seconds;
	if debuginfo > 0, say "[input-style]Body damage [body soreness of the player] -> ";
	compute unique soreness effect of F;
	BodyHeal 1;
	if debuginfo > 0, say "[body soreness of the player][roman type][line break]";
	compute normal effect of F.

[!<computeUniqueFurnitureSorenessEffect>+

By default, does nothing

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player is resting on

+!]
To compute unique soreness effect of (F - a furniture):
	do nothing.


[!<computeFurnitureAlerting>+

This function is called whenever a nearby monster interrupts the player's resting.

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player was resting on

+!]
To compute alerting of (F - a furniture):
	say "Your rest has been interrupted!";
	now resting is 0;
	now the alert of the player is 0.

[!<computeFurnitureRestCompletion>+

This function is called when the player finishes resting without being interrupted

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player was resting on

+!]
To compute rest completion of (F - a furniture):
	if the bimbo of the player < 11, say "[first custom style]I feel so much better![roman type][line break]";
	otherwise say "[second custom style]I'm full of energy again. Yum![roman type][line break]";
	now resting is 0;
	now auto is 1;
	try standing;
	now auto is 0.

[!<computeFurnitureRestCompletion>+

Called whenever the player stops resting, regardless of the reason why. Does nothing by default

@param <Furniture>:<F> The furniture the player was resting on

+!]
To compute rest ending of (F - a furniture):
	dislodge F.
