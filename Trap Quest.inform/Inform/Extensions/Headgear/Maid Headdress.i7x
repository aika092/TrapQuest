To compute periodic effect of (H - a maid headdress):
	[compute headgear chances of H;]
	compute hair growth of H;

	let S be a random worn pink spraybottle;
	if S is clothing and the work ethic of S < 0:[not cleaning enough? You might be punished!]
		[if debugmode > 0, say "The work ethic of S is [the work ethic of S]";]
		let R be a random number between -4000 and -130;
		[if debugmode > 0, say "R is [R]";]
		if S is clothing and the work ethic of S < R, compute spraybottle punishment.

	if the headgear chance of H < the threshold of H and (M is actually summonable or (M is maid outfit and maid-summoned is 0)):

		summon M cursed;
		now maid-summoned is 1;
		now the raw-magic-modifier of M is 0;
		increase the raw-magic-modifier of M by the crawl count of the player / 10;
	otherwise if the headgear chance of H < (2 + unlucky) and there is a worn maid outfit and C is actually summonable and the player is horny:
		say "[bold type]You suddenly feel a tightness around your loins.
