To compute cowgirl horniness:[cowgirls get horny if they're in the dungeon at the same time as the minotaur.]
	if the player is in the dungeon and there is an alive minotaurs and the class of the player is cowgirl:
		let M be a random minotaur in the location of the player;
		if M is monster and the arousal of the player < 3000 and the player is able to get horny:
			say "All it takes is one whiff of the [M]'s virile musk to send a wave of arousal rippling through your body. [second custom style]M-moooo.[roman type][line break]";
			now the arousal of the player is 3500;[the cowgirl is instantly horny in the same room as the minotaur, no matter what]
		otherwise if M is monster and a random number between 1 and 3 is 1:
			say "Spending time close to the [M] is causing your body to react to his potent virile hormones. You [if the arousal of the player > 1]get even more aroused![otherwise]can feel arousal building up inside you![end if]";
			arouse 300;
		otherwise if the player is in Dungeon36 and M is not monster and a random number between 1 and 3 is 1:

	if P is cow piercing and the number of worn nipple piercing is 0, now pierce is 1;
	let T be a random off-stage nintendolls-brand tattoo;
	if the headgear chance of H < the threshold of H:[We only check once so we avoid lag.]
		if Q is actually summonable:
			say "[bold type]Your cow ears barely noticeably quiver, and then a [ShortDesc of Q] materialises on your chest.[roman type][line break]";
			summon Q cursed;
			now Q is milk production;
			now the raw-magic-modifier of Q is the largeness of breasts / 4;
			now cow-summoned is 1;
			now basque-summoned is 1;
		otherwise if B is actually summonable or (B is bra and cow-summoned is 0):
			if cow-summoned is 0:
				repeat with O running through worn breast covering clothing:
					if B is bra or B is totally-exclusive or B is bottom-exclusive:
						say "Your [O] vanishes!";
						destroy O;
			say "[bold type]Your cow ears barely noticeably quiver, and then a cow print bikini top materialises on your chest.[roman type][line break]";
			summon B cursed;
			now B is milk production;
			now the raw-magic-modifier of B is the largeness of breasts / 4;
			now cow-summoned is 1;
		otherwise if (the largeness of breasts > 15 or (the largeness of breasts > 8 and the largeness of breasts >= max breast size)) and (T is actually summonable or pierce is 1):
			say "[bold type]Your cow ears barely noticeably quiver, and then suddenly you feel searing pain from your breasts! [if pierce is 1 and there is worn breast covering clothing]The clothing covering your breasts tears to shreds as a[otherwise]A[end if] [if pierce is 1]pair of high-gauge rings have appeared in your nipples[end if][if pierce is 1 and T is actually summonable], and even worse the [otherwise if T is actually summonable]The [otherwise]![end if][if T is actually summonable]Nintendolls logo is now branded just below your breasts![end if][roman type][line break]";[possible break this up in some way.]
