Headgear Framework by Headgear begins here.

A headgear is a kind of clothing. headgear is unique. headgear can be hair growing. A headgear is usually manly.

Definition: a headgear is roleplay: decide no. [Can this headgear appear in the wardrobe when picking the random headgear starting option.]

To decide which number is the default-soak-limit of (C - a headgear): decide on 5.

headgear can be blondeness-neutral, blondeness-positive, blondeness-negative (this is the blondeness-influence property). headgear is usually blondeness-neutral.
headgear can be brightness-neutral, brightness-positive, brightness-negative (this is the brightness-influence property). headgear is usually brightness-neutral.
headgear can be redness-neutral, redness-positive, redness-negative (this is the redness-influence property). headgear is usually redness-neutral.

[Headgear cannot be normally cursed or blessed because this is what tracks its 'quest' of sorts.]

Definition: a headgear is cursable: decide no.
Definition: a headgear is magic-enhanceable: decide yes.
Definition: a headgear is blessable: decide no.
Definition: a headgear is class-transformation-protected: decide yes.
Definition: a headgear is immune to change: decide yes.

[Headgears come with quests. These quests (unless super special) will reward with jewellery or stats the first time they are completed, then X the second time they are completed, and then minor healing from then on.]

To assign quest to (C - a headgear):
	do nothing.

A game universe initialisation rule:
	repeat with H running through on-stage headgear:
		set up H. [otherwise they don't get their quests]

To compute persistent reward of (Q - a headgear-clothing-quest) on (C - a clothing):
	if C is cursed:
		compute generic first time class reward of Q on C;
	otherwise if C is bland:
		compute generic second time class reward of Q on C;
	otherwise:
		compute generic class reward of Q on C.

To compute generic first time class reward of (Q - a clothing-quest) on (C - a clothing):
	let D be a random off-stage plentiful ring;
	if D is ring:
		now D is pink diamond;
		set shortcut of D;
		if D is actually summonable:
			summon D;
		otherwise:
			now D is in the location of the player;
		say "summoning a [MediumDesc of D] [if D is worn]straight onto your finger[otherwise]right in front of you[end if]!";
	otherwise:
		compute generic second time class reward of Q on C.

To compute generic second time class reward of (Q - a headgear-clothing-quest) on (C - a clothing):
	if frozen hair is 0 and ((C is not brightness-positive and the brightness of hair > natural brightness * 3) or (C is not redness-positive and the redness of hair > natural redness * 3) or (C is not blondeness-positive and the blondeness of hair > natural blondeness * 3)):
		say "darkening your hair colour!";
		if C is not brightness-positive, HairBrightDown 1;
		if C is not blondeness-positive, HairBlondeDown 1;
		if C is not redness-positive, HairRedDown 1;
	otherwise:
		say "[if the player is shameless]repairing some of your self-esteem[otherwise]filling you with pride[end if]!";
		dignify 2500.

To compute generic class reward of (Q - a headgear-clothing-quest) on (C - a clothing):
	if C is hair growing or the raw largeness of hair <= 1 or frozen hair is 1:
		say "filling you with renewed energy!";
		repeat with F running through fuckholes:
			heal F times 5;
		now the fatigue of the player is 0;
	otherwise:
		say "shrinking the length of your hair!";
		HairDown 1;
	let D be a random off-stage plentiful ring;
	if D is ring:
		now D is emerald;
		set shortcut of D;
		if D is actually summonable:
			summon D;
		otherwise:
			now D is in the location of the player;
		say "You're also rewarded with a bonus [MediumDesc of D], which appears [if D is worn]straight onto your finger[otherwise]right in front of you[end if]!".

Report taking off headgear: [Otherwise the player could remove the headgear, remove the nasty class blocked clothing items, then replace the headgear.]
	if the player is not in a predicament room, compute AutoRemoveFizzling of the noun.

Report dropping headgear: [Otherwise the player could remove the headgear, remove the nasty class blocked clothing items, then replace the headgear.]
	if the player is not in a predicament room, compute AutoRemoveFizzling of the noun.

To compute AutoRemoveFizzling of (H - a headgear):
	if H is in-play:
		say "As you remove the [ShortDesc of H], it fizzles into nothingness. ";
		only destroy H. [Headgear only comes once in a while]

The list of headgear recycling is a list of headgear that varies.

To commence recycling of (C - a headgear):
	now C is in Holding Pen;
	compute recycling of C;
	release recycled headgear;
	if debugmode is 1, say "Adding [C] to recent headgear list. List now looks like this: [list of headgear recycling].";

To compute recycling of (C - a headgear):
	add C to the list of headgear recycling, if absent.

[We might need to reset some variables or something, I dunno]
To compute unique recycling of (C - a headgear):
	do nothing.

To release recycled headgear:
	while the number of entries in the list of headgear recycling > (4 - (diaper quest * 2)):
		let C be entry 1 in the list of headgear recycling;
		remove C from play;
		remove C from the list of headgear recycling;
		now C is cursed; [Should be already but let's make double sure]
		compute unique recycling of C.

To say ShortDesc of (C - a headgear):
	say "headwear".

To compute hair colour change of (H - a headgear):
	if frozen hair is 0:
		let flav-said be 0;
		if the brightness of hair < 3 and H is brightness-positive:
			say "[if flav-said is 0]You feel your [ShortDesc of H] changing your hair colour, making it[otherwise] and[end if] brighter";
			now flav-said is 1;
		if the brightness of hair > 0 and H is brightness-negative:
			say "[if flav-said is 0]You feel your [ShortDesc of H] changing your hair colour, making it[otherwise] and[end if] darker";
			now flav-said is 1;
		if the blondeness of hair < 3 and H is blondeness-positive:
			say "[if flav-said is 0]You feel your [ShortDesc of H] changing your hair colour, making it[otherwise] and[end if] more blonde";
			now flav-said is 1;
		if the blondeness of hair > 0 and H is blondeness-negative:
			say "[if flav-said is 0]You feel your [ShortDesc of H] changing your hair colour, making it[otherwise] and[end if] less blonde";
			now flav-said is 1;
		if the redness of hair < 3 and H is redness-positive:
			say "[if flav-said is 0]You feel your [ShortDesc of H] changing your hair colour, making it[otherwise] and[end if] more red";
			now flav-said is 1;
		if the redness of hair > 0 and H is redness-negative:
			say "[if flav-said is 0]You feel your [ShortDesc of H] changing your hair colour, making it[otherwise] and[end if] less red";
			now flav-said is 1;
		if flav-said is 1, say ".";
		[these need to go afterwards because they might cause something to be printed]
		if the brightness of hair < 3 and H is brightness-positive, HairBrightUp 1;
		if the brightness of hair > 0 and H is brightness-negative, HairBrightDown 1;
		if the blondeness of hair < 3 and H is blondeness-positive, HairBlondeUp 1;
		if the blondeness of hair > 0 and H is blondeness-negative, HairBlondeDown 1;
		if the redness of hair < 3 and H is redness-positive, HairRedUp 1;
		if the redness of hair > 0 and H is redness-negative, HairRedDown 1.


To decide which number is the initial outrage of (C - a headgear):
	decide on 1.

To set up magic state of (C - a headgear):

To compute hair growth of (H - a headgear):
	if diaper quest is 0 and H is hair growing:
		say "Your [ShortDesc of H] feels warm as your hair grows slightly.";

To summon (H - a headgear):
	only destroy H; [This cleans up all potentially incorrect flags except ripped and various effects]
	only summon H;
	if the player is not in a predicament room:
		follow the player class rules;
		compute hair growth of H;
		compute hair colour change of H;
		compute class outfit of H.

To compute post transformation effect of (H - a headgear):
	let PC1 be the substituted form of "[player-class]";
	follow the player class rules;
	let PC2 be the substituted form of "[player-class]";
	unless PC1 matches the text PC2, compute class outfit of H. [In general if the player changes class they get a new outfit where possible. NB this won't replace clothing that is still class-relevant, that will need to be done manually]

Report wearing a headgear:
	if the player is not in a predicament room:
		follow the player class rules;
		compute class outfit of the noun.

To compute class outfit of (H - a headgear):
	do nothing. [This will be replaced with the headgear spawning the default class outfit using the "class summon" function on each item of clothing.]

To compute class set up of (C - a clothing): [Any unique changes to its state when it's summoned as part of a class outfit]
	if C is gloves or C is sex toy, now C is cursed; [With rare exceptions these are always 'bad stuff' that need to come into play cursed]
	if C is sex toy:

	now C is cursed.

Report taking clothing:
	if the noun is unidentified autobinding clothing and the player is not in a predicament room and the noun is unclash summonable:
		if the noun is identified:
			say "BUG - game tried to autobind clothing that was already identified. Please report this.";
		otherwise:
			say "[bold type]Suddenly, [NameDesc of the noun] disappears from your hands![roman type][line break]";
			autobind the noun.

	dislodge C;
	now C is in pink wardrobe.

[Removes all clothing that shouldn't be worn at the same time as the new item and sends them to the pink wardrobe. Should be called BEFORE the new item is summoned. This function needs to match the function below.]

Part - Wearability

headgear wearability rules is a rulebook. The wearability rules of headgear is usually headgear wearability rules.

This is the headgear already worn rule:
	repeat with O running through worn headgear:

			if summoning is 0 and autowear is false, say "You can't wear that because [if O is wearing-target]you're already wearing it[otherwise]you're already wearing the [printed name of O][end if]!";
			rule fails.
The headgear already worn rule is listed in the headgear wearability rules.
