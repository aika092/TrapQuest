Headgear Framework by Headgear begins here.


A headgear is a kind of clothing. headgear is unique. headgear can be hair growing. The soak-limit of a headgear is usually 7.  A headgear has a number called hair-charge.  A headgear has a number called colour-charge.  A headgear has a number called outfit-charge.  A headgear is usually manly.
A headgear can be roleplay. A headgear is usually not roleplay. [Can this headgear appear in the wardrobe when picking the random headgear starting option.]

headgear can be blondeness-neutral, blondeness-positive, blondeness-negative (this is the blondeness-influence property). headgear is usually blondeness-neutral.
headgear can be brightness-neutral, brightness-positive, brightness-negative (this is the brightness-influence property). headgear is usually brightness-neutral.
headgear can be redness-neutral, redness-positive, redness-negative (this is the redness-influence property). headgear is usually redness-neutral.

[Headgear cannot be normally cursed or blessed because this is what tracks its 'quest' of sorts.]

Definition: a headgear is cursable: decide no.
Definition: a headgear is magic-enhanceable: decide yes.
Definition: a headgear is blessable: decide no.
Definition: a headgear is class-transformation-protected: decide yes.
Definition: an object is removal-blocking: decide no. [Some items (mainly headgear) can prevent other clothing from being removed until it is removed, e.g. tiara blocks royal dress from being removed]

[Headgears come with quests. These quests (unless super special) will reward with jewellery or stats the first time they are completed, then X the second time they are completed, and then minor healing from then on.]

To assign quest to (C - a headgear):
	do nothing.

A game universe initialisation rule:
	repeat with H running through on-stage headgear:
		set up H. [otherwise they don't get their quests]


To compute persistent reward of (Q - a headgear-clothing-quest) on (C - a clothing):
	if C is cursed:
		compute generic first time class reward of Q on C;
	otherwise if C is bland:
		compute generic second time class reward of Q on C;
	otherwise:
		compute generic class reward of Q on C.

To compute generic first time class reward of (Q - a clothing-quest) on (C - a clothing):
	let D be a random off-stage ring;
	if D is ring:
		now D is pink diamond;
		set shortcut of D;
		if D is actually summonable:
			summon D;
		otherwise:
			now D is in the location of the player;
		say "summoning a [MediumDesc of D] [if D is worn]straight onto your finger[otherwise]right in front of you[end if]!";
	[otherwise if the raw intelligence of the player < the raw dexterity of the player:
		say "increasing your brainpower!";
		IntUp 1;
	otherwise if the raw dexterity of the player < 30:
		say "improving your agility!";
		DexUp 1;]
	otherwise:
		compute generic second time class reward of Q on C.

To compute generic second time class reward of (Q - a headgear-clothing-quest) on (C - a clothing):
	say "[if the player is shameless]repairing some of your self-esteem[otherwise]filling you with pride[end if]!";
	dignify 2500.

To compute generic class reward of (Q - a headgear-clothing-quest) on (C - a clothing):
	say "filling you with renewed energy!";
	repeat with F running through fuckholes:
		heal F times 5;
	now the fatigue of the player is 0.


Report taking off headgear: [Otherwise the player could remove the headgear, remove the nasty class blocked clothing items, then replace the headgear.]
	compute AutoRemoveFizzling of the noun.

Report dropping headgear: [Otherwise the player could remove the headgear, remove the nasty class blocked clothing items, then replace the headgear.]
	compute AutoRemoveFizzling of the noun.

To compute AutoRemoveFizzling of (H - a headgear):
	if H is in-play:
		say "As you remove the [ShortDesc of H], it fizzles into nothingness. ";
		only destroy H;
		commence recycling of H. [Headgear only comes once in a while]

The list of headgear recycling is a list of headgear that varies.

To commence recycling of (C - a headgear):
	now C is in Holding Pen;
	compute recycling of C;
	release recycled headgear.

To compute recycling of (C - a headgear):
	add C to the list of headgear recycling.

[We might need to reset some variables or something, I dunno]
To compute unique recycling of (C - a headgear):
	do nothing.

To release recycled headgear:
	while the number of entries in the list of headgear recycling > (4 - (diaper quest * 2)):
		let C be entry 1 in the list of headgear recycling;
		remove C from play;
		remove C from the list of headgear recycling;
		now C is cursed; [Should be already but let's make double sure]
		compute unique recycling of C.


To say ShortDesc of (C - a headgear):
	say "headwear".

To say wardrobeVanishes of (C - a clothing):
	say "[one of]vanishes. You can sense that it has been sent to the pink wardrobe[or]is sent from your [body area of C] to the pink wardrobe[stopping]";
	dislodge C.

Definition: a headgear (called B) is ingredient:
	if B is product, decide no;
	decide yes.

To decide which number is the crafting key of (B - a headgear):
	decide on 33.

To compute hair colour change of (H - a headgear):
	increase the colour-charge of H by 1;
	if the colour-charge of H > the hair threshold of H:
		now the colour-charge of H is 0;
		let C be a random number between 1 and 3;
		if H is redness-neutral, now C is 1;[when we can't increase redness we force check brightness. NOTE: brightness increase is most likely.]
		if C is 1:
			if the brightness of hair < 3 and H is brightness-positive:
				say "You feel your [printed name of H] changing your hair colour.";
				HairBrightUp 1;
			if the brightness of hair > 0 and H is brightness-negative:
				say "You feel your [printed name of H] changing your hair colour.";
				HairBrightDown 1;
			if H is brightness-neutral, now C is 2;[we couldn't increase brightness so we try blondeness]
		if C is 2:
			if the blondeness of hair < 3 and H is blondeness-positive:
				say "Your feel your [printed name of H] changing your hair colour.";
				HairBlondeUp 1;
			if the blondeness of hair > 0 and H is blondeness-negative:
				say "You feel your [printed name of H] changing your hair colour.";
				HairBlondeDown 1;
			if H is blondeness-neutral, now C is 3;[couldn't increase blondeness so let's try redness]
		if C is 3:
			if the redness of hair < 3 and H is redness-positive:
				say "You feel your [printed name of H] changing your hair colour.";
				HairRedUp 1;
			if the redness of hair > 0 and H is redness-negative:
				say "You feel your [printed name of H] changing your hair colour.";
				HairRedDown 1.

To compute hair colour darken of (H - a headgear): [Some awesome headgears darken hair when blessed]
	if H is blessed and frozen hair is 0:
		increase the colour-charge of H by 1;
		if the colour-charge of H > the hair threshold of H * 3:
			now the colour-charge of H is 0;
			if the redness of hair > natural redness * 3 or the brightness of hair > natural brightness * 3 or the blondeness of hair > natural blondeness * 3:
				say "You feel the blessed holy power your [ShortDesc of H] darkening your hair colour. ";
				HairBrightDown 1;
				HairBlondeDown 1;
				HairRedDown 1.

To decide which number is the initial outrage of (C - a headgear):
	decide on 1.

To set up magic state of (C - a headgear):
	do nothing.

To compute periodic effect of (H - a headgear):
	if the player is not in a predicament room:
		if diaper quest is 0:
			compute hair growth of H;
			compute hair colour change of H;
		compute outfit of H;
		compute unique periodic effect of H.

To compute unique periodic effect of (H - a headgear):
	do nothing.

To compute outfit of (H - a headgear):
	increase the outfit-charge of H by 1;
	if the outfit-charge of H > the outfit threshold of H:
		now the outfit-charge of H is 0;
		compute class outfit of H.

To decide which number is the outfit threshold of (H - a headgear):
	decide on 25.

To decide which number is the hair threshold of (H - a headgear):
	if H is cursed:
		decide on 30;
	otherwise if H is blessed:
		decide on 75;
	otherwise:
		decide on 60.

To compute hair growth of (H - a headgear):
	if diaper quest is 0 and H is hair growing:
		increase the hair-charge of H by 1;
		if the hair-charge of H > the hair threshold of H + (the raw largeness of hair * 3):
			now the hair-charge of H is 0;
			say "Your [ShortDesc of H] feels warm as your hair grows slightly.";
			HairUp 1.

To compute class outfit of (H - a headgear):
	do nothing.

Definition: a headgear is too boring: decide no.

Definition: a headgear is too adult: decide no.

Definition: a headgear is stealable: decide no.

Definition: a headgear is destructible: decide no.

Part - Wearability

headgear wearability rules is a rulebook. The wearability rules of headgear is usually headgear wearability rules.

This is the headgear already worn rule:
	repeat with O running through worn headgear:
		unless wearing-target is scrunchie and the number of worn scrunchie is 1 and O is scrunchie: [A second scrunchie headgear can appear to turn a ponytail into a pigtail.]
			if summoning is 0 and autowear is false, say "You can't wear that because [if O is wearing-target]you're already wearing it[otherwise]you're already wearing the [printed name of O][end if]!";
			rule fails.
The headgear already worn rule is listed in the headgear wearability rules.

Carry out wearing headgear:
	compute HeadgearAutoCursing of the noun.

To compute HeadgearAutoCursing of (H - a headgear):
	if H is not cursed:
		say "As you put it on, it becomes cursed, sealing itself to your [ShortDesc of hair]!";
		now H is cursed.
