		say "Your body hair is normal for a male, if a little on the light side: it's not like you're a hairy ape!  [one of][if the bimbo of the player < 7 and appearance-outrage-level < 9]It's a pity you don't have more chest hair: in this game, with only the weird clothing around, you hate to imagine what your chest would look like in some of the [italic type]girlier[roman type] options might loom before you.  [end if]Your lack of chest hair could make you appear a little androgynous.  [if the bimbo of the player < 10][variable custom style]Hmm.[roman type][end if][line break]Otherwise, the hair on your body is pretty normal, though far from dramatic; visible enough if someone looks, but not standing out as a major feature of your body.[line break]Your Adam[']s apple is there, visible enough to anyone who looks[if the player is able to speak and the bimbo of the player < 5], and you rumble a 'Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3' under your breath as if you're doing a mic-check, feeling a little silly as you do so.  It's a good match to your voice in real life. That's some cool technology they're using![otherwise].[end if][line break]Even your skin feels just like it does in real life - slightly rough, and very far from thin, well able to resist bumps and abrasions. Maybe not rough or tough skin, but pretty normal, for a guy![line break][if the player is able to use manual dexterity]You flex your hands and fingers, which[otherwise]Your hands and fingers[end if] look exactly like they should, the fingers strong, and the hands a good size. [if the bimbo of the player < 5 and the strength of the player > 7]If you're being honest with yourself, you sometimes wish your fingers were a bit longer - but at least they're robust and strong![end if][line break][if the strength of the player > 7]You check your arms and leg muscles - they're a long way from a weight-lifter or a body-builder's, but they're quite decent, considering.[end if][or][stopping]";
	otherwise if the size of penis > min penis size + 3:
		say "[one of]Has your body hair changed? [if the largeness of hair > 2 or the blondeness of hair > 0 or the brightness of hair > 0 or the redness of hair > 0]You know the hair on your head has, so you check the rest of yourself out.  [end if]Is the hair on your arms, and legs, a little finer, maybe softer?  A little less visible to the eye? Nah, it's just your state of dress, and the general tone of this simulation getting to you a bit.  You're pretty sure your hair is normally like that.  It wasn't like you were a hairy ape to start with, after all.[line break]You feel your neck, checking out your Adam's apple, [if the bimbo of the player < 8]then worry at[otherwise]and are surprised by[end if] what you feel.  Didn't [italic type]that[roman type] use to be a bit more prominent?  Is it a little reduced?  [if the player is able to speak and the bimbo of the player < 8]You murmur a few words, listening closely to your own soft voice.  Has it changed?  You're not sure; and for some reason you hesitate to boom something out in your normal male voice: who knows what [']attention['] you'd attract?[end if][line break]You check out your fingers and hands, opening and closing them and trying to decide if they look somehow... different?  You're not sure. [if the bimbo of the player < 8][variable custom style]I'd better keep an eye on that.[roman type][end if][line break]Finally, you check out your muscles, and the way you move.  [if the bimbo of the player < 8 and the raw strength of the player > the starting strength of the player and the raw dexterity of the player > the starting dexterity of the player]A little relieved, if anything: you look a little more toned, as well as moving with more flexibility than you normally manage. Though your muscles aren't exactly [italic type]bulging[roman type].  [end if]They look kind of... sexy, somehow.[or][stopping]";
	otherwise if the size of penis > min penis size + 2:
		say "[one of]You check out the hair you had on your body.  [if the bimbo of the player < 8][variable custom style]Uh oh.[roman type]  [end if]It's definitely become finer and less visible to the eye. A quick glance at your arms and legs confirms it: it's much thinner and sparser, and even lighter.  In a dim light, it'd be hard to see it at all!  And has your [italic type]pubic[roman type] hair changed, too?  You feel it, and it feels a lot less springy and coarse.  The shape of it seems different somehow, too.  It makes your [sissy-penis] all the more obvious. [if the bimbo of the player < 10]For the moment, you avoid thinking about your [sissy-penis].[end if][line break]Absently feeling at your neck you realise your slender Adam's apple has receded.   You run your fingers up and down your neck: has it gotten a bit longer?  For some reason, it seems smoother; the word [']swanlike['] springs to mind.[line break][if the player is able to speak and the bimbo of the player < 10]You test your voice, and a shiver runs through you as you notice it's definitely taken on a softer, gentler tone.  Is it higher, too?  Again, you test it out - quietly, so as not to draw attention - and even singing a little of one of your favourite songs.  But you stop with a small thrill of shock when you realise you can't reach the lower notes: your voice just fails when you try to get down there![line break][end if]Still feeling a little shocky, you run your hands over your body, and your eyes widen as you notice your skin has become supple, silky and soft. It feels like the skin of one of your ex-girlfriends, Amanda.  Her skin was so soft, it really used to turn you on.[line break][if the bimbo of the player < 7][variable custom style]Shit!  My skin is as soft as Amanda's?  No wonder I seem to be attracting so much unwanted attention in here![roman type][end if][line break][if the bimbo of the player < 8]Blinking in stunned disbelief, y[otherwise]Y[end if]our eyes drift to your hands, and another shock washes through you: they look thinner, your fingers more tapered, maybe [italic type]longer[roman type]?  You just stare at them: your hands and fingers look... elegant, even.[line break]You check out your arms, and legs, admiring the play of subtle but defined muscles, as you move and spin on the spot, just to check out your mobility.  It's not immediately obvious, but something about your musculature looks different.  [if the raw strength of the player > the starting strength of the player and the raw dexterity of the player > the starting dexterity of the player]You feel stronger, and generally better-balanced, but your limbs don't [italic type]look[roman type] that way[otherwise]Your limbs have definitely changed[end if].  Why are you suddenly thinking of female gymnasts you've admired?[or][stopping]";
	otherwise if the size of penis > min penis size:
		say "[one of]You examine the hair you had on your body. [if the bimbo of the player < 8][variable custom style]Oh, no![roman type]  [end if]At first glance it looks like you don't have any at all, as if you've been shaved all over.  But when you peer more closely at your arms and legs, it's kind of worse than that: yeah, you [italic type]do[roman type] have hair, but it's just a fine dusting, like you'd see on a bikini model, with that almost-transparent fineness that just makes the delicate hairs glow golden in sunlight. And your soft, cushion-y pubic hair has changed into a less bushy, more 'shaped' pattern[if the bimbo of the player < 8] that you don't want to think about right now[end if]![line break][if the bimbo of the player < 8]Worriedly f[otherwise]F[end if]eeling your previously slender Adam's apple, you have trouble even finding it!  You put both hands to your neck, sliding them up and down between your lower jaw and your collarbone... wait, what?  Your hands used to touch both of them at the same time: you didn't used to be able to slide your hands up and down your neck!  Your neck feels... slender.  Longer.  [italic type]Swanlike[roman type], for certain.  And your hands: you lower them from your neck and just stare at them.[line break][if the bimbo of the player < 10][variable custom style]These aren't my hands![roman type]  [end if]They're smaller, the knuckles hardly visible, each finger longer and slender.  [if the bimbo of the player < 12][variable custom style]My god![roman type]  [end if]They look elegant, sexy.  The nails are small and rounder.  These are feminine hands.  [italic type]Really[roman type] feminine.  And they're yours!  You turn them over, and over, flexing your fingers[if the sex addiction of the player > 9], imagining them curled lovingly around that sexy, big-boobed doll with the thrusting dick, or one of the guards['] living, meaty-[line break][end if][if the sex addiction of the player > 13][second custom style]Mmm, that's a nice thought.[roman type][otherwise if the sex addiction of the player > 9][variable custom style]Shit!  What am I thinking?[roman type]  You shake your head, trying to dislodge the very-unwanted image as you continue your self-examination.[end if][line break][or][stopping]";
		say "[one of][if the player is able to speak and the bimbo of the player < 9][variable custom style]'What was I doing?  Oh, yeah, this effing game has shrunk my Adam's apple!'[roman type]  You test your voice, and feel your dick shrivel even as it kind of thrills and swells at the same time, stirred by the sweet voice that emerges from your... plump lips?  [end if]Your delicate fingertips graze the surface of your lips, noticing the strange tingle that sends through you: a kind of hot shiver that snakes down from your swollen lips, sweeping past your chest - making the nipples swell tautly erect - shivering down through your belly to make your groin throb and pound; the pulse of your blood engorging everything [italic type]down there[roman type] and making it ready for action.  [if the sex addiction of the player > 9]You realise you're still running your fingertips across your lips, your mind starting to drift once more to that valiant royal guard... or the shopkeeper - yum! [end if][if the sex addiction of the player > 9 and the sex addiction of the player < 13]- and you have to drag your thoughts away once again. [variable custom style]Shit!  When did my lips get so plump and... sensitive?[roman type][end if][line break]You run your hands over your body, feeling the inward-sweeping curves of your sides, and just how supple, silky and soft your skin has become.  [if the sex addiction of the player < 10]You feel the urge to cup and stroke your breasts, but you're already feeling a little, um, worked up - just from examining yourself! - and decide maybe you'd better not, right now.[end if][line break]You catch yourself admiring your arms, and their sleek musculature: [if the raw strength of the player > the starting strength of the player]power without[otherwise]no[end if] unpleasant bulges!  And your legs - wow, any dancer you know would be proud to have legs as nicely rounded, knees as cutely dimpled as yours!  When did your knees become so cute, and your ankles so thin?[or][stopping]";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]You see that the fine dusting of hair you had on your body has completely disappeared. A close examination of your utterly hairless chest, and your arms and legs confirms it: you are now shorn of all body hair aside from your pubic area.  You peer closer, hardly believing what you're seeing: there's no hair at all, not even any [italic type]follicles[roman type]!  Your skin looks perfect, unnaturally so: you realise if you were photographed now, the men poring over your succulent image would assume it had been airbrushed!  You feel your cheeks, suddenly stunned by just how baby-soft the skin feels.  And your touch sends a tingle through you, too.  Your skin seems to have become really sensitive.  Delicate.[line break]You feel your swanlike neck, noting the continued absence of your Adam's apple[if the player is able to speak], and hesitantly test your voice...  For a moment, you can't quite believe that the girly voice is yours, wondering if perhaps that cute but desperate wench has sneaked up behind you, and is the one actually talking?[end if][line break]You lick your lips[if the bimbo of the player < 8], a bit frightened, but[otherwise] and[end if] as your tongue curls up and over your soft and very plump lips, they start to tingle again, and there's a quiver of reaction that automatically makes you open your mouth and pucker them, while your tongue plays across them, stirring them further, deepening the bizarre thrill shooting through you, making your head swim with images of thrusting, swelling, [italic type]suckable[roman type][if the semen taste addiction of the player > 10][manly-penis]s[otherwise]-[line break]With an effort of will, you draw back your - longer? - tongue, and try to calm down, forcing your thoughts back on track[end if].[line break]You find yourself staring admiringly at your slender, toned arms and your gorgeously-curved female legs, comparing them to stocking-clad gams you've seen in men's magazines.  It's kind of [if the bimbo of the player < 10]horrible, but also somehow [end if]wonderful: realising that yours are probably better than anything you've seen in any of them!  [if the player is upright]You can't resist bending from the waist just to make the muscles stretch out behind in mouth-wateringly sleek definition, and you twist around to peer lustfully down at your own legs![end if][line break][variable custom style]These are MY legs?![roman type][line break][if the bimbo of the player < 10]It takes an effort of will to look away.[line break][end if][variable custom style]I'm freaking gorgeous![roman type][line break][or][stopping]".
