+!]
This is the do nothing rule:
	rule succeeds.


The maximum score is 150.

[!<diaperQuestFixRules:Rulebook>*

This is run at the start of the game if DQ is enabled. It allows people to create rules for how the starting environment is 'fixed' for DQ.

*!]
The diaper quest fix rules is a rulebook.

[!<WhenPlayBegins>+

This is the second procedure the game runs when the game is opened, the first one being the one that reads in the files and checks if there's a save file (this can be found in 'roguelike saving'). We start throwing menus at the player.
