Section - Greasing the wheels for callbacks

[From John Clemens: http://www.math.psu.edu/clemens/IF/I7tricks.html#command]

 To say perform/@ (ph - phrase): (- if (0==0) {ph} -).

Section - Restart the timer after restoring
[The state of the timer is not automatically restored, so we must start a timer on restore at the same speed it was running when the game was saved.]

First report restoring the game:
	reset the Glulx timer;
	continue the action.

Section - Restart the timer after undoing

[The state of the timer is not automatically saved with the game state, so we must start a timer after undoing at the same speed it was running when the game state was saved.]

The immediately undo rule response (E) is "[@ reset the Glulx timer][bracket]Previous turn undone.[close bracket]".

To decide what number is glk event handled in (ev - a g-event) context:
	(- HandleGlkEvent(gg_event, {ev}, gg_arguments) -)

The global timer interval is a number variable. The global timer interval is 50.

Section - Glk events (for use without Glulx Input Loops by Erik Temple)
[This section provides definitions and phrase wrappers that allow us to write I7 code for handling raw input. This code comes from the Glulx Input Loops extensions, so we include it only if that extension is not also present.]

A g-event is a kind of value. The g-events are timer-event, char-event, line-event, mouse-event, arrange-event, redraw-event, sound-notify-event, hyperlink-event, and volume-event.

Definition: A g-event is window-independent rather than window-dependent if it is timer-event or it is sound-notify-event or it is arrange-event or it is redraw-event.

Definition: A g-event is glk-initiated if it is timer-event or it is sound-notify-event or it is arrange-event or it is not redraw-event.


To decide which g-event is null-event: (- 0 -)

To wait for glk input:
	(- glk_select(gg_event); -)

To decide which g-event is the current glk event:
	(- gg_event-->0 -)

To decide which number is the window of the current glk event:
	(- gg_event-->1 -)

To decide what number is the character code returned:
	(- gg_event-->2 -)

To pause/stop the/-- Glulx timer:
	request repeating Glk timer event at 0 milliseconds.

To request repeating Glk timer event at (T - a number) milliseconds:
	if debugmode > 0, say "[input-style]Timer set to [T]ms intervals.[roman type][line break]";
	actually request repeating Glk timer event at T milliseconds.

To actually request repeating Glk timer event at (T - a number) milliseconds:
	(- glk_request_timer_events({T}); (+ global timer interval +) = {T}; -).

To reset the/-- Glulx timer:
	request repeating Glk timer event at 50 milliseconds.

To render buffered stuff:
	wait before continuing.


To wait (N - a number) ms before continuing:
	request repeating Glk timer event at N milliseconds;
	let event-outcome be a number;
	wait for glk input;
	if the current glk event is glk-initiated, now event-outcome is glk event handled in null-event context;
	reset the Glulx timer.

To wait before continuing:
	if the glulx replacement command is "skip":
		repeat with G running through g-animated animation tracks:
			cease animation of G;
	let event-outcome be a number;
	wait for glk input;
	if the current glk event is glk-initiated, now event-outcome is glk event handled in null-event context.

	repeat with F running through figure-names:
		if the Glulx Resource ID of F is N, decide on F.

To fill (T - an animation track) from (F - a figure-name) to (N - a number):

Section - Functions

Glulx input handling rule for a timer-event:
	if animationsEnabled is 1 or there is a g-animated initial animation track, compute animations.

To compute animations:
	repeat with T running through g-animated animation tracks:
		if buttonsLatest is not the target-window of T and (PopupButtons > 0 or the target-window of T is map-window or the target-window of T is graphics-window): [Don't want animations to draw over buttons, which they would do without these checks]
			if the number of blank rows in the Table of Graphlink Glulx Replacement Commands is greater than 20 or the target-window of T is map-window or the target-window of T is graphics-window, compute animation of T. [If the graphlink table is almost full, that probably means that this animation has been going for some time, re-adding hyperlinks each time. Let's stop animating, to leave 20 hyperlinks spare for the popup buttons or similar.]

To kill all animations:
	repeat with T running through g-animated animation tracks:
		cease animation of T.

To wait until animations are over:
	wait before continuing;
	if animationsEnabled is 1 or there is a g-animated initial animation track:
		while there is g-animated animation track:
			wait before continuing.



To compute TQanimation of (F - a figure-name) in (W - a g-window) at (X1 - a number) by (Y1 - a number) with dimensions (BX - a number) by (BY - a number):
