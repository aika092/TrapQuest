Game Universe Initialisation by Miscellaneous Backend begins here.


[!<StartTheMachine>+

The button has been pushed, let's set up the actual game environment.  Doing this separately from engine initialisation allows us to split up the setup lag at the start of the game into two chunks.

+!]
To Start The Machine:
	Set Up The Dungeon;
	Set Up Monsters;
	if debugmode > 1, say "Finished setting up monsters.";
	if debugmode > 1, say "Now configuring pink smoke.";
	move pink smoke backdrop to all smoky rooms;
	if debugmode > 1, say "Now configuring toilets.";
	move toilet backdrop to all toilets rooms;
	now the player is in Dungeon12;
	if spontaneous tattoos is 1:
		let T be a random ink-me tattoo;
		summon T;
		say "You notice that [if latex prisoner is 0]you are naked, and that [end if]you have a tattoo of the words 'INK ME' on the back of your left hand.[line break]";
	if background-nurse is 1:
		let B be a random bandage;
		now B is held by the player;
		say "You notice that you seem to have some medical supplies. Handy![line break]";
	if latex prisoner is 1, initialise latex prisoner;
	if bondage prisoner is 1, initialise bondage prisoner;
	if debugmode > 1, say "Now initialising wardrobe.";
	initialise wardrobe;
	now the pink pill is held by the player;
	say "You notice you are holding a small pink pill in your hand.";
	set up debug stuff;
	[Depending on which way round we open the character window and map window, one will be bigger than the other.  So we have allowed the user to decide which with the "larger window" option.]
	if character larger is 1 and side images > 0, display stuff;
	if map images is 1, display entire map;
	if character larger is 0 and side images > 0, display stuff;
	if inline hyperlinks >= 1:
		initialise hyperlink stuff;
		fill hyperlink window;
	display entire map; [Otherwise setting up hyperlinks will have fucked up the map screen size]
	if the player is able to automatically slap or the player is able to automatically knee or the player is able to automatically kick, do nothing. [For some reason the first time these queries are called, it causes newlines we don't want.  So let's make that happen here.]

[!<InitialiseLatexPrisoner>+

Used at the start of the game to encase the player in latex items, if that option has been enabled.

+!]
To initialise latex prisoner:
	let R be a random number between 1 and 2;
	say "You suddenly feel your body encased in a skin-tight suit.  You look down and see you are encased in latex!  You feel your feet forced onto tip toes as a pair of latex fetish heels are magically secured to them.  Suddenly you feel your [if the player is female][vagina] and [end if][asshole] invaded by [if the player is male]a plug[otherwise]plugs[end if].[line break][first custom style]Oh no...[roman type][line break]The [if the player is female]rear [end if]plug starts vibrating!";
	now a random off-stage latex basic loot heels is worn by the player;
	now a random off-stage latex basic loot bra is worn by the player;
	now a random off-stage vibrating plug panties is worn by the player;
	now a random black rubber stockings is worn by the player;
	now a random off-stage catsuit is worn by the player;
	repeat with C running through worn clothing:
		now C is cursed;
		if a random number between 1 and 4 is 1, now the raw-magic-modifier of C is -2;
		otherwise now the raw-magic-modifier of C is -1;
		now C is identified;
		now C is sure;
		now C is normal;
		if C is heels:
			now C is posture training;
			now the heel-height of C is 2;
		if C is vibrating plug panties:
			now the damage of C is 7;
			now C is penetrating asshole;
			if the player is female, now C is penetrating vagina;
		if C is overdress:

You don't even have time to consider the implications of this before [end if]your mouth is forced open by the appearance of a [printed name of G]![line break][if D is worn]Just as you think it's over, your eyes widen in shock as a [printed name of D] materialises over your chastity cage![line break][end if][first custom style]'MMMMMMPH!'[roman type][line break]".

	while C < 2 and H is scrunchie:
