[!<crashdebug:Integer>*

Sometimes when there are a lot of crashes during fainting we enable this to allow checkpoints during fainting so we can see how far the interpreter got so that we can work out which bit is causing the crash. When it's set to 1, the game will spit out "CHECKPOINT 1", "CHECKPOINT 2" etc. during the resetting of the map.

*!]
crashdebug is a number that varies. crashdebug is 0.

[!<quickStart:Integer>*

Used to track what game mode was selected.
