Weight Gain by Player begins here.

Part 1 - Calculate Weight Stats

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsTheFatWeightOfThePlayer>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is the fat-weight of the player:
	let F be the flesh volume of thighs + the flesh volume of arms + the flesh volume of hips + the flesh volume of belly;
	if F > 0, decide on F;
	decide on 0.

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsTheWeightOfThePlayer>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is the weight of the player:
	let B be 0;
	repeat with P running through body parts:
		increase B by the weight of P;
	now B is B / 3; [Some attempted balancing]
	increase B by 10; [This is how much the head and the rest of the player's body weighs. In reality of course it would be much larger but for the purposes of potentially having players floating, this is what it will be.]
	if there is a worn butterfly wings, decrease B by 3;
	if the latex-transformation of the player > 6 and B > 0, now B is 0; [THIS SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY, but at the moment it is here as a failsafe.]
	decide on B.

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsTheRelievedHeavinessOfThing>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is the relieved heaviness of (H - a thing):
	if H is currently-in-bag, decide on 0;
	decide on the heaviness of H.

Report examining a carried thing:
	if the relieved heaviness of the noun > 0:
		say "It ";
		if there is a worn bag of holding, say "can't go in your bag of holding[if the noun is messed knickers] (because of the biological waste on it)[otherwise if the noun is wet clothing] (because of the liquid soaked into it)[end if] so it ";
		say "is currently [if the relieved heaviness of the noun > 4]massively[otherwise if the relieved heaviness of the noun > 2]significantly[otherwise if the relieved heaviness of the noun > 1]noticeably[otherwise]slightly[end if] weighing you down.";

To decide which number is the heaviness of (H - a thing):
	decide on 0.

weightSaved is a number that varies.

savedInventoryWeight is a number that varies.
savedWornWeight is a number that varies.

[!<DecideWhcihNumberIsInventoryWeight>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is inventory weight:
	if weightSaved is 0, update weight;
	decide on savedInventoryWeight.

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsWornWeight>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is worn weight:
	if weightSaved is 0, update weight;
	decide on savedWornWeight.

To update weight:
	let W be 0;
	repeat with H running through carried things:
		increase W by the relieved heaviness of H;
	now savedInventoryWeight is W / 3;
	now W is 0;
	repeat with H running through worn things:
		increase W by the heaviness of H;
	now savedWornWeight is W / 5;
	now weightSaved is 1.

Report examining held thing:
	let H be 0.0;
	if the noun is carried:
		now H is the relieved heaviness of the noun / 3;
	otherwise:
		now H is the heaviness of the noun / 5;
	if H > 0.35:
		say "It is weighing you down a [if H >= 1.2]huge amount[otherwise if H >= 0.9]large amount[otherwise if H > 0.5]decent amount[otherwise]bit[end if].";
	otherwise if H > 0.0:
		say "It doesn't weigh you down much to [if the noun is carried]have this in your inventory[otherwise]wear this[end if].".

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsFatigueWeight>+

Base calculation on how much fatigue goes up by each turn while standing.

+!]
To decide which number is fatigue weight:
	decide on (((inventory weight + worn weight + the weight of the player) scaled) * 5) / (10 + (background-sporty * 2)).

[!<DecideWhichNumberIsItemWeight>+

Base calculation on how much items are weighing the player down.

+!]
To decide which number is item weight:
	decide on ((inventory weight + worn weight) * 10) / (10 + (background-sporty * 2)).

Definition: yourself is overburdened if item weight > 6.

This is the reset overburdened rule:
	now weightSaved is 0.
The reset overburdened rule is listed in the advance counters rules.

overburdenWarned is initially false.
An advance counters rule (this is the overburdened warning rule):
	if overburdenWarned is false:
		now overburdenWarned is true;
		if the player is overburdened, say "[bold type]You are wearing and carrying a lot of heavy stuff[if there is worn bag of holding] that can't go in your bag[end if]. Your dexterity will be reduced until you drop some.[roman type][line break]".

Report taking something:
	follow the reset overburdened rule. [This means that we'll recalculate weight after this action]
Report wearing something:
	follow the reset overburdened rule. [This means that we'll recalculate weight after this action]
Report dropping something:
	follow the reset overburdened rule. [This means that we'll recalculate weight after this action]
Report taking off something:
	follow the reset overburdened rule. [This means that we'll recalculate weight after this action]

Part 2 - Manage Fat Stats


[!<CarryOutGoing>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

Every item in your inventory, except a small few (e.g. the pink pill), weighs you down, meaning your fatigue increases faster. Clothing you're wearing weighs you down a lot lot less than the clothing you're carrying. Metal items and drinks tend to weigh even more than everything else. You should consider making a trip back to the starting room, and put all your spare stuff you can't wear in the pink wardrobe, where it'll be safe even if you faint.[roman type][line break][or][stopping]";
