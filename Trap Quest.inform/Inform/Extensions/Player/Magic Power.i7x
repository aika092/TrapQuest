Part - Spells

A magic-spell is a kind of backdrop.
A magic-spell has a number called the outrageousness.
A magic-spell has a text called the incantation. [Understand the incantation property as describing a magic-spell.] [Unnecessary because we also set the text shortcut to this]

Table of Possible Incantations
phrase (text)	naughtiness (number)
with 50 blank rows


To say NewbieSpellFlav:
	if newbie tips is 1, say "[one of][newbie style]Newbie tip: You've found a magic spell! Spells consume magic power, which is not particularly plentiful but you should hopefully acquire a bit of it over your adventure. Most spells require you to say the rude words while someone can hear (and understand) you.[roman type][line break][or][stopping]".

	say "ERROR - missing effect description for [S]".

Definition: a magic-spell is uncastable rather than castable if the incantation of it is "".
Definition: a magic-spell is fetish appropriate: decide yes.

Spellcasting is an action applying to one thing.
Check Spellcasting:
	if the noun is uncastable, say "You don't know that spell." instead;
	if the player is not able to speak, say "You can't currently speak in order to perform the incantation!" instead.
Carry Out Spellcasting:
	allocate 3 seconds;
	say CastFlav of the noun.
Report Spellcasting:
	if there is a reactive monster or the noun is not reactive-only:

		compute spell consequences of the noun;
		repeat with M running through reactive monsters:
			if M is in L, compute spell outrageousness reaction of M to the noun;
	otherwise:
		say "Nothing happens. It would seem that this spell only works when used in front of someone who can listen and understand the words.[one of][line break][variable custom style]The laws of this universe are so stupid!!![roman type][line break][or][stopping]".
Understand "I [magic-spell]" as Spellcasting.


To say CastFlav of (S - a magic-spell):
	[say "[variable custom style]'I [incantation of S]!'[roman type][line break]";]
	if there is a reactive monster, say "You declare loudly[if the outrageousness of S * 300 > the humiliation of the player], trying to say it quickly[one of] to get it over with as fast as possible[or][stopping][otherwise if the outrageousness of S * 350 < the humiliation of the player], making sure to pronounce each syllable correctly[end if]. [HumiliateReflect (the outrageousness of S * 10 * the number of reactive monsters)]";
	otherwise say "You declare out loud to nobody in particular.".

To compute spell outrageousness reaction of (M - a monster) to (S - a magic-spell):
	if M is uninterested and M is unfriendly:
		check perception of M;
	otherwise:
		let O be the latest-appearance of M;
		if diaper quest is 1, now O is the latest-cringe of M;
		if the outrageousness of S > O:
			if M is uninterested, now M is interested;
			if diaper quest is 0, compute disapproval of M;
			otherwise compute cringe disapproval of M.
