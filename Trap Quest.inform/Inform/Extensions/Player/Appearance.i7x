	potentially update appearance and cringe levels;
	decide on the saved appearance of the player.

To decide which number is the saved appearance of the player: [When an NPC looks at the player, how slutty do they look?]
	let A be 0;
	increase A by (the number of live things penetrating a body part * 3);
	if appearance-explained is 1, say "After sex status, outrage is [A]; ";
	increase A by calculated-cumulative-outrage-level;
	if appearance-explained is 1, say "After clothing & nudity, outrage is [A]; ";
	repeat with C running through worn wearthings:
		if C is currently visible:
			increase A by the perceived-bimbo-influence of C;

	let A2 be A / 2;
	let A3 be A - A2;
	let N be 0;
	let maxSimilarItems be 4;
	repeat with C running through worn currently at least partially visible wearthings:

		if the outrage of C / 2 >= A2, increase N by 1;
	repeat with C running through body parts:
		if the outrage of C >= A2, increase N by 1;
	if N > maxSimilarItems, now N is maxSimilarItems;
	decrease A by (A3 * (maxSimilarItems - N)) / maxSimilarItems; [The more items there are within 50% of A, the less we subtract from A. And if there are lots of lewd items within 50% of A, appearance hits its max value for this item, i.e. its raw outrage rating.]
	if appearance-explained is 1, say "(cumulative outrage level is [A]) ";
	if A > 20, decide on 20;
