[doll-stuck is meant to be used in remarks that refer to you being stuck on a dildo trap that's trying to
 force you to pose like a little dolly.  In this case, the only such trap will be one that makes you pose
 like a ballerina - because you're wearing ballerina wearables.
 If it's set to "", it's a flag that you're not currently stuck like that.
 To be used in case we use some randomness to decide whether the 'pose' attack initiates.
 In this first implementation, it will always do it if you have two ballerina wearthings.
 I had to add doll-stuck-num, even though redundant, because you can't test 'if doll-stuck is ""' inside say "...".
 Aika has hijacked doll-stuck-num to count the turns the player has been impaled.
    doll-stuck-num: Number of turns the player has been turning around, posed like a doll in a music box.
 doll-stuck-kind is used to record the kind of doll the dildo wants you to pose as:
 doll-stuck-kind:
	0: Not doll stuck at all.
	1: Ballerina.
	2: TBD
]

doll-stuck-kind is a number that varies.  doll-stuck-kind is 0.
