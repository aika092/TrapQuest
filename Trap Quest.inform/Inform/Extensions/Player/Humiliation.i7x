Balancing humiliation:
All humiliation events should use one of the above constants, and then relate to each other based on those constants

Eating food with semen on it, for example, is

MODERATE-HUMILIATION - SLIGHT-HUMILIATION * 2

There is a noticeable difference between this event and the average moderate event, but not enough that it can be fully described as a slight event.

Submitting for a round during sex is

MODERATE-HUMILIATION + SLIGHT-HUMILIATION * 3

This is significantly more humiliating than the average moderate event, but not so much that it can be described as a strong event

[!<HumiliateX>+

The humiliation function multiplies whatever number is plugged into it, so the same event is less humiliating if it occurs when the player is shameless rather than proud. A humiliate 100 at 0 humiliation humiliates 450. At 10000 humiliation it humiliates 400. At 20000 humiliation it humiliates 350. At 30000 humiliation it humiliates 300 and at 40000 humiliation it humiliates 250. As such, any number plugged into this function from anywhere is larger than it seems.

Once the humiliation amount is decided, the number is passed to the delayed humiliation number, which allows the game to store multiple humiliation hits without exploding with output.
