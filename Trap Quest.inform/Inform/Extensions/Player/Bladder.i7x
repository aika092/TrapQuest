Bladder by Player begins here.

Definition: a person is able to pee:
	if the latex-transformation of the player > 4, decide no;
	decide yes.

To BladderUp (X - a number):
	let P be bladder-bursting-level;
	let old-bursting be 0;
	if the player is bursting, now old-bursting is 1;
	if the player is not able to pee, now X is 0;
	if the player is not barbie:
		if watersports mechanics is 1:
			increase the bladder of the player by 2 * X;
			if the player is pheromonal:
				let N be 3 * X;
				increase the bladder of the player by N / 2;
			if the bladder of the player > 12: [slower increase beyond twelve]
				decrease the bladder of the player by X;
			if the bladder of the player > 20: [maximum 20]
				now the bladder of the player is 20;
		if (the player is bursting or the bladder of the player >= 14) and player-urinating is not 1 and the player is not fake bursting:
			if the player is diapered:
				if bladder-bursting-level >= 2 and P < 2:
					say "[if the delicateness of the player < 17][line break][variable custom style]I'm going to pee myself in my diaper any minute now![otherwise][line break][second custom style][NameBimbo] needs to go tinkles really bad![end if][roman type][line break]";
				otherwise if bladder-bursting-level >= 0 and P < 0:
					say "[bold type]You could really do with [if the humiliation of the player < 5000]finding a toilet![otherwise]using your diaper![end if][roman type][line break]";
				otherwise if old-bursting is 0 and the player is bursting:
					say "[bold type]You are starting to feel the need to [if the humiliation of the player < 5000]use the rest room.[otherwise]use your diaper.[end if][roman type][line break]";
			otherwise:
				if bladder-bursting-level >= 2 and P < 2:
					say "[if the bimbo of the player < 17][line break][variable custom style]Uh-oh, at this rate I'm going to wet myself![otherwise][line break][second custom style][NameBimbo] needs to go tinkles really bad![end if][roman type][line break]";
				otherwise if bladder-bursting-level >= 0 and P < 0:
					say "[bold type]You could really do with [if the humiliation of the player < 5000]finding a toilet![otherwise]having a piss![end if][roman type][line break]";
				otherwise if old-bursting is 0 and the player is bursting:
					say "[bold type]You are starting to feel the need to [if the humiliation of the player < 5000]use the rest room.[otherwise]pee.[end if][roman type][line break]";
			if old-bursting is 0 and the player is bursting:
				if newbie tips is 1, say "[one of][newbie style]Newbie tip: Looks like someone needs to take a leak! Having a full bladder lowers your dexterity, so it makes sense to pee. However there are lots of reasons not to:[line break]* Soiled clothing [if diaper lover >= 1](apart from diapers) massively reduce your dexterity as you are grossed out and [end if]will significantly worsen your appearance rating if visible[if diaper lover >= 1]. Diapers themselves can make it very difficult to walk upright when overly soaked[end if].[line break]* Puddles on the floor give you a [if there are worn heels]higher [end if]chance of falling over.[line break][if diaper lover >= 1]Urine puddles also massively gross you out and lower dexterity, and also the player will refuse to rest on furniture here.[line break][end if]Eventually you'll urinate involuntarily[if diaper lover >= 1], and if this happens too many times you'll become incontinent, unable to control when you pee[end if].[line break]So, overall the best way to urinate is to find a body of water or a room with toilets[if diaper lover >= 1] - doing this also gradually recovers lost continence[end if].[roman type][line break][or][stopping]".

To BladderDown (X - a number):
	decrease the bladder of the player by X;
	if the bladder of the player < 0:
		now the bladder of the player is 0.

The player has a number called raw-irritable-bladder.
To IrritableBladderUp (N - number):
	if diaper lover > 0 and the raw-irritable-bladder of the player < 1000:
		say "You sense that your bladder will be more irritable in the future.";
		SilentlyIrritableBladderUp N.
To SilentlyIrritableBladderUp (N - number):
	if diaper lover > 0 and the raw-irritable-bladder of the player < 1000:
		increase the raw-irritable-bladder of the player by N;
		if the raw-irritable-bladder of the player > 1000, now the raw-irritable-bladder of the player is 1000.

To decide which number is the irritable-bladder of the player:
	let I be the raw-irritable-bladder of the player;
	if I > 1000, decide on 1000;
	decide on I.

irritated-bladder is initially false.

An all time based rule (this is the irritable bladder rule):
	if the player is bursting:
		if irritated-bladder is false:
			let R be a random number between 1 and 1000;
			if R <= the irritable-bladder of the player:
				now irritated-bladder is true;
				say "[bold type]Your irritable bladder is starting to send urgent messages of extreme discomfort to your brain. Until you no longer feel like you need to pee, your strength, dexterity and intelligence will all be significantly reduced.[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise if irritated-bladder is true:
		now irritated-bladder is false;
		say "The pressure in your bladder has gone, and your strength, dexterity and intelligence are no longer being dampened.".

[How high will the game allow bladder incontinence to go?]
To decide which number is the max-bladder-incontinence of the player:
	decide on 10 - (incontinence protection * 2).

The player has a number called raw-bladder-incontinence.

To BladderIncontinenceUp (N - number):
	if diaper lover > 0 and the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player < the max-bladder-incontinence of the player:
		say "You feel your ability to hold onto your bladder weakening.";

		increase the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player by N;
		if the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player > the max-bladder-incontinence of the player, now the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player is the max-bladder-incontinence of the player.

To BladderIncontinenceDown (N - number):
	if the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player > 0:
		say "You feel your ability to hold onto your bladder [if N is 1 and the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player > 1]slightly [otherwise if the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player > N + 2]somewhat [end if]returning.";
		SilentlyBladderIncontinenceDown N.
To SilentlyBladderIncontinenceDown (N - number):
	decrease the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player by N;
	if the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player < 0, now the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player is 0.


temporary-bladder-incontinence is a number that varies.
To progress temporary incontinence:
	if temporary-bladder-incontinence > 0:
		let DA be 0;
		if the player is bladder diaper aware, now DA is 1;
		decrease temporary-bladder-incontinence by 1;
		if temporary-bladder-incontinence is 0 and the bladder-incontinence of the player < the max-bladder-incontinence of the player:

			if DA is 0 and the player is bladder diaper aware: [Player has regained the ability to detect when they urinate into a diaper]
				let C be a random worn diaper;

	if temporary-rectum-incontinence > 0:
		let DA be 0;
		if the player is rectum diaper aware, now DA is 1;
		decrease temporary-rectum-incontinence by 1;

			say "[bold type]You feel that the magic curse that was making you completely incontinent has finally lifted![line break][variable custom style]I can feel my rectum again![roman type][line break]";
			if DA is 0 and the player is rectum diaper aware: [Player has regained the ability to detect when they urinate into a diaper]
				let C be a random worn diaper;
				if C is diaper, compute awakened state check of C.
To TemporaryIncontinenceUp (N - a number):
	if diaper messing >= 3 and a random number between 0 and 1 is 1, increase temporary-rectum-incontinence by N;
	increase temporary-bladder-incontinence by N.

To decide which number is the bladder-incontinence-influence of (C - a wearthing):
	decide on 0.
To decide which number is the bladder-incontinence-influence of (C - a clothing):
	let N be 0;
	if C is maturity, decrease N by 1;
	if C is bed wetting, increase N by 1;
	if C is diaper or C is bladder-incontinence-influencing:
		decrease N by the magic-modifier of C;
	decide on N.

To decide which number is the bladder-incontinence of the player:
	if temporary-bladder-incontinence > 0, decide on the max-bladder-incontinence of the player;
	let I be the raw-bladder-incontinence of the player;
	repeat with C running through worn wearthings:
		increase I by the bladder-incontinence-influence of C;
	if I > the max-bladder-incontinence of the player, decide on the max-bladder-incontinence of the player;
	decide on I.

[!<YourselfIsBladderIncontinent>+

This is essentially the highest level of bladder incontinence that matters, because at this level all control is taken away from the player.

+!]
Definition: yourself is bladder incontinent:
	if the bladder-incontinence of the player >= 8, decide yes;
	decide no.

	decide no.
Definition: yourself is totally incontinent:
	if the player is bladder incontinent and (diaper messing < 3 or the player is rectum incontinent), decide yes;
	decide no.


Definition: yourself is at least somewhat bladder continent: [we use this to check whether there's any point in applying more bladder continence reducing effects to the player.]

[The level of bladder at which the player has a chance to squirt out a bit of pee when surprised / distracted]
To decide which number is bladder-squirty-level:
	let N be 7;
	decrease N by the bladder-incontinence of the player;
	decrease N by the womb volume of vagina / 10; [pregnancy makes you need to go more]
	increase N by yellow theme bonus;

To decide which number is bladder-risky-level:
	let N be 12;
	decrease N by the bladder-incontinence of the player;
	decrease N by the womb volume of vagina / 10; [pregnancy makes you need to go more]
	increase N by yellow theme bonus;

	decide on N.

[As bladder rises further above bladder-risky-level, the player is more likely to wet themselves each turn]
To decide which number is bladder-bursting-level:
	decide on the bladder of the player - bladder-risky-level.

[!<YourselfIsDesperateToPee>+

Is the player at risk of wetting themselves (and aware)?

+!]
Definition: yourself is really bursting:
	if the player is bursting and bladder-bursting-level > 0, decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide which number is burstingColour:
	[unless the player is bursting, decide on 16777215;] [white] [unnecessary because the only time this is used we have already checked that the player is bursting]
	if failed potty training tattoo is worn, decide on 16777215; [white]
	if the player is fake bursting, decide on lightModeFullRed; [red]
	let R-component be 255;

		now B-component is G-component;
	otherwise: [gradually go from green to pale red]
		now R-component is (255 * the bladder of the player) / bladder-risky-level;
		now B-component is R-component / 2;
		now G-component is 255 - B-component;
	decide on (R-component * 65536) + (G-component * 256) + B-component.

A game universe initialisation rule:
	if tough-shit is 1 and diaper lover > 0:
		now the bladder of the player is bladder-risky-level + 2;
		if diaper messing >= 4:
			now rectum is 4;
