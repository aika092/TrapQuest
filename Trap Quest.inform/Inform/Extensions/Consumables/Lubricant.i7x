	otherwise:
		say "A small douche of oil-based lubricant, which rather embarrassingly says 'SLUT LUBE' in big white letters on the side. Even worse, because it's a liquid, it can't be hidden inside your bag of holding. You can apply this to an orifice to make it slippery and less sore.".

Lubing is an action applying to one thing.
Check lubing:
	if the noun is make up kit, try brushing the noun with face instead;
	if the noun is not lubricant, try drinking the noun instead;
	if the player is not possessing a vagina, try orilubing the noun with asshole instead.

To decide which number is the heaviness of (C - a lubricant):
	decide on 1.

Carry out lubing:
	say "You should [bold type]use[roman type] this lube [bold type]on an orifice[roman type].".

Understand "apply [something]", "use [something]" as lubing.

Does the player mean orilubing lubricant with body part: it is very likely.

Orilubing it with is an action applying to two things.
Check orilubing something with:
	if the second noun is a dispenser, try decanting the noun with the second noun instead;
	if the noun is squirt dildo and the second noun is a fuckhole:
		if the noun is penetrating the second noun, try squirting the noun instead;
		otherwise say "You need to put it in your [variable second noun] first." instead;
	if the noun is make up kit, try brushing the noun with the second noun instead;
	if the noun is powder and the second noun is clothing, try PowderRubbing the noun on the second noun instead;
	if the noun is not lubricant, say "This verb is used for lubrication!" instead;
	if the second noun is not an orifice:
		if the second noun is hips, try orilubing the noun with asshole instead;
		if the second noun is a monster, say "That might be possible in the future, but not right now." instead;
		otherwise say "You can only use lube on one of your own orifices." instead;
	if the second noun is face, try drinking the noun instead;
	if there is a lubricant covering the second noun and the soreness of the second noun is 0, say "Your [variable second noun] is already covered in [lubricant]." instead;
	if the latex-transformation of the player > 3, say "You don't see how that would help, your latex insides are naturally smooth and slippery and not at risk of getting sore." instead;
	let T be a random thing penetrating the second noun;
	if T is a live thing:
		say "You can't lube up your [variable second noun] while there is something fucking it." instead;
	if the player is not able to manually use their hands, do nothing instead;
	if the player is monster fucked, say "You're a little busy right now!" instead.

Carry out orilubing something with:
	allocate 6 seconds;
	let F be the second noun;
	let T be a random thing penetrating F;
	if T is a thing:
		say "You carefully apply [lubricant] to [FuckerDesc of T] and the entrance of your [variable F], until the friction is less intense. ";
	otherwise if the bimbo of the player < 8:
		say "You delicately apply [lubricant] to your [variable F], until it feels a little less dry. ";
	otherwise if the bimbo of the player < 14:
		say "You liberally squirt [lubricant] deep into your [variable F], until it feels nice and slippery all the way inside. ";
	otherwise:
		say "You generously lube up your whole hand and [if the openness of F > 7]fist your own [variable F][otherwise]shove as many fingers as you can fit into your [variable F][end if]. Mmm, that feels a lot better. ";
	if the soreness of F > 0:
		heal F times 3;
	lube up F with the noun.

Understand "use [something] on [something]", "apply [something] on [something]", "apply [something] in [something]", "squirt [something] on [something]", "squirt [something] in [something]", "squeeze [something] on [something]", "squeeze [something] in [something]" as orilubing it with.

Check drinking lubricant:
	if the sex addiction of the player < 8 and the thirst of the player < 4, say "You aren't thirsty or perverted enough to bring yourself to do that." instead.

Carry out drinking lubricant:
	say "[if the bimbo of the player < 10]You hold your nose and squeeze the flavoured lube into your mouth, swallowing tentatively. [otherwise]You happily squeeze the flavoured lube into your mouth. [end if]It coats the inside of your throat![line break][if the oral sex addiction of the player > 6][line break][second custom style]I'm probably better at deepthroating now![roman type][line break][end if]";
	OralSexAddictUp 1;
	StomachUp 1;
	lube up face with the noun.

To lube up (O - an orifice) with (L - a lubricant):
	now L is covering O;
	now the timer of the noun is a random number between 300 and 600;
	compute player submission;
	say "You discard the empty bottle of [lubricant].";
	check stealing of L;
	remove L from play.

An all time based rule (this is the lubricant drying rule):
	repeat with L running through lubricants covering an orifice:
		if there is a worn refreshment clothing:
			do nothing;
		otherwise if spit first tattoo is worn and L is covering asshole and a random number between 1 and 3 > 1: [The tattoo makes it take much longer for the lube to dry on assholes]
			do nothing;
		otherwise if seconds < the timer of L:
			decrease the timer of L by time-seconds;
		otherwise:
			now the timer of L is 0;
			repeat with F running through orifices covered by L:
				now L is not covering F;
				say "[bold type]The lubricant coating your [variable F][bold type] has dried up[roman type].".

To restock (C - a lubricant):
	let B be a random off-stage lubricant;
	if B is lubricant:
		repeat with L running through Standard Item Pen:
			if L is lubricant, remove L from Standard Item Pen;
		add B to Standard Item Pen.

This is the setup starting lubricants rule:
	let C be a random lubricant;
	restock C.
The setup starting lubricants rule is listed in the setup starting items rules.

	decide on 3.

To decide which number is the outrage of (T - a lubricant):
	decide on 10.

To uniquely destroy (C - a lubricant):
	now C is not covering asshole;
	now C is not covering vagina;
	now C is not covering face;
