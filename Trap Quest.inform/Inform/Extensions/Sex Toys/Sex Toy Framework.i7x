To decide which number is the initial outrage of (S - a sex toy):
	decide on 11.

To decide which number is the unworn outrage of (S - a sex toy):
	let O be (the initial outrage of S) + (the size of S);
	if O > 20, decide on 20;
	if O < 0, decide on 0;
	decide on O.

To decide which number is the outrage of (S - a sex toy):
