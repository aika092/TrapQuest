Within seconds, a familiarly looking larva has emerged from the egg. The wasp keeps dropping its seemingly magic reproductive juices onto the giant maggot, which, right in front of your eyes, goes through the entire metamorphosis which a normal wasp goes through in its youth, in a few seconds. Before you realise what has happened, there are two identical giant wasps hovering in front of you.
