Rude,['] and then I'm like [']Story time!['] and then I tell them my life story, and it's actually super long. I was talking to Andrew the other day, and... wait, do you know Andrew? [one of]You don't know Andrew. OK, Andrew was Linda's BEST FRIEND in college. They went to the bathroom together all the time!

Are you gay? WOW!['] OK, you know Andrew.[or]I told you already. He's the gay guy that always did Linda's makeup when they were in the bathroom together, but to be honest he wasn't very good at it because her mascara was always runny and stuff, and her lipstick was smeared, like, everywhere. OK, you know Andrew.[stopping] Anyway, Andrew told me he had this super long thing to show me and I was like [']WOW, that sounds super long['], and then he took out his [manly-penis] and I was like, [']That's really long,['] and then he got a boner and I was like [']UM, do I look like a man to you?['] I hate Andrew.

So I thought maybe why not, like, do what I do anyway, but like, get paid for it, right?  So anyway the reason I was thinking about this is because I'd just arrived at this school place, right. You know the school?  Oh right, where we are right now, yeah!  So you know the school. So I was thinking, I've got to become a teacher, right?  So I start talking about stuff and things and whatever and this guy who was like TOTALLY rude just shoved [if diaper quest is 1]a pacifier[otherwise]his [manly-penis][end if] into my mouth and was all like [']That should shut you up['] and I was all like [']Oh hell no['] and so I like sucked on it but also like kept on talking, right?  Because I can do both at the same time. I know, it sounds a bit weird but I can, trust me. So I'm like sucking on this stupid thing and trying to be a teacher at the same time and whatever and then I get told no I'm not a teacher I'm a student, right?  Like, who does that, you know what I mean?  But then they point to my armband, and roll their eyes. So rude, right?  But anyway, I look at my armband and they're totally right; like, totally!  So anyway yeah that's why I can't like [']teach['] you anything. Or whatever.'[roman type][line break]".

Next time it's detention,['] and I was like, [']Um, no. It's the third time,['] but actually I lost track, so she took me to detention and she made me wear this [if diaper quest is 1]pacifier[otherwise]huge gag[end if] and told me I couldn't take it out for the rest of the day, and then I didn't say anything, because I was kind of, like, stunned.
