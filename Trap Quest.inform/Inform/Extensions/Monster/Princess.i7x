[big he of M][']s wearing nothing except for a thick diaper, a tiara, a pink arm binder and a pink collar. The arm binder is connected to a hole in the ceiling by a tight rope, and [his of M] collar is similarly connected to a hole in the ground by another tight rope. These two ropes serve to allow the [ShortDesc of M][']s captors to move [him of M] into any position of their choice and hold [him of M] there, without needing to go into the room themselves. A clear tube descends in front of the [ShortDesc of M][if the current-torment of M <= 0], with several soiled diapers ready to exit through the flap. However, they are currently being held in place thanks to [NameDesc of M][']s nose and face obstructing the exit, pressed unpleasantly into the worst part of the frontmost diaper[end if]. Several other used diapers litter the ground, no doubt having at some point descended from the tube, which is likely connected to the diaper pail in the nearby hallway. In summary, it would appear that every diaper used by a member of the school ends up in [NameDesc of M][']s cell, essentially making [his of M] cell into a giant diaper pail.[paragraph break]An intercom system has been set up to allow any speakers to communicate with [NameDesc of M]. You also notice a keyhole to the side of the viewing portal, presumably for use on the rare occasion that [he of M] is fed or [his of M] pail is cleaned out. A big button is also accessible to you, on a stand in front of the viewing portal.
