Part 3 - Combat

Section 1 - Attack


[
How the cultist works, currently:

Default action:
She drags you to the dark altar to become a "vessel"

Player is pregnant already:
She leaves the player be.

Player isn't female or can't become pregnant:
She drags the player to the altar to sacrifice them.

The player is a cultist:
She is more likely to leave the player alone the less progression the doom counter has.

The player has a penis, and either they have an erection, they presented their penis for sex, or the doom quest is at a low level:
She doesn't do anything yet, and sees if she can ride the player instead.
