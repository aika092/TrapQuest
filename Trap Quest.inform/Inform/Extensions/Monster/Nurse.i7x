A magic purple vibrator is embedded in [his of M] butthole, visibly and audibly buzzing away inside [his of M] ass, never tiring, never ceasing. [big his of M] [if bukkake fetish is 1]cum covered [end if]facial expression reveals [his of M] mental state - vacant, orgasm-addled, but happy.

Her diaper is beginning to leak now, as you watch a steady sticky stream of [semen] trickle down her right leg. It would appear that she's been cursed to have her anal cavity constantly slowly filled with [semen]...[end if]";

		say "Even the nurse of this institution is not immune from its theme: [his of M] tight purple latex dress hugs [his of M] slim figure and emphasises the curves of [his of M] [if lady fetish is 2]ass[otherwise]tits and ass[end if]. White rubber gloves, a white rubber nurse headband and a matching rubber nurse apron complete the look, which screams 'fetish'. [big his of M] long black hair rests alluringly on [his of M] shoulders. Black lipstick and a naughty grin gives [him of M] a slight air of... evil.
