To say RoboBellboyDesc:
	if images visible is 1, display figure of robobellboy;
	say "A small, bucket-shaped robot with a red uniform stylishly painted onto its clunky body. The words  '[if item described is mechanical robobellboy]Bell-Bot 1.3[otherwise if the item described is whirring robobellboy]Bellomatic 4000[otherwise if the item described is wheeled robobellboy]Peon Unit 4.0[otherwise if the item described is speedy robobellboy]BellTron 58[end if]' are printed directly onto its metal chassis, which has a seam running straight down the center, allowing it to open up like a door. It has a single, rectangular [']eye['], which glows faintly as it glides around silently on a single, oversized wheel. You can occasionally hear small bits of radio feedback from the dimpled antennae on top, which seem to correspond with tiny micro-movements of its oversized, accordion-like arms.".

To set up (M - a robobellboy):
	reset M;
	now the monstersetup of M is 1;
	now the target-room of M is the location of a random on-stage HotelBedPatrons;
	now the difficulty of M is 5;
	now the health of M is the maxhealth of M.

To decide which room is the nearest patron:
	let D be 100;
	let H be Hotel01;
	repeat with B running through HotelBedPatrons:
		if the distance of the location of B < D and the distance of the location of B >= 0:
			now H is the location of B;
			now D is the distance of the location of B;
	decide on H.

This is the spawn initial robobellboy rule:
	if the number of alive robobellboys is 0:
		if debugmode > 0, say "Summoning bellboy in hotel.";
		let M be a random robobellboy;
		while M is senior robobellboy:[never the first one to spawn.]

Section 1 - Attack

The latex punishment rule of a robobellboy is usually the no latex punishment rule.

The unique punishment rule of a robobellboy is usually the robobellboy punishment rule.
