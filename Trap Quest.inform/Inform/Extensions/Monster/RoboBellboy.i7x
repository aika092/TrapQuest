RoboBellboy by Monster begins here.

A robobellboy is a kind of robot. Understand "bellboy", "bell", "boy" as robobellboy. A robobellboy is usually intelligent. The favour of a robobellboy is usually 11. The leftover-type of a robobellboy is usually 117. A robobellboy has a number called whore-intent.

Definition: A robobellboy is hotel dwelling: decide yes.

Figure of robobellboy is the file "NPCs/Hotel/Robot/robobellboy1.png".

Figure of RoboBellboy Cutscene 1 is the file "Special/Cutscene/cutscene-robobellboy-perception1.png".

speedy robobellboy is a robobellboy. The text-shortcut of speedy robobellboy is "sbe".
whirring robobellboy is a robobellboy. The text-shortcut of whirring robobellboy is "wbe".
mechanical robobellboy is a robobellboy. The text-shortcut of mechanical robobellboy is "mbe".
wheeled robobellboy is a robobellboy. The text-shortcut of wheeled robobellboy is "wrb".

To say ShortDesc of (M - a robobellboy):
	say "RoboBellboy".

To say MediumDesc of (M - speedy robobellboy):
	say "speedy RoboBellboy".
To say MediumDesc of (M - whirring robobellboy):
	say "whirring RoboBellboy".
To say MediumDesc of (M - mechanical robobellboy):
	say "mechanical RoboBellboy".
To say MediumDesc of (M - wheeled robobellboy):
	say "wheeled RoboBellboy".

To decide which figure-name is the monster-image of (M - a robobellboy):
	decide on figure of robobellboy.

To say MonsterDesc of (M - a robobellboy):
	say "A small, human-shaped robot with a red uniform stylishly painted onto its clunky body. The words  '[if item described is mechanical robobellboy]Bell-Bot 1.3[otherwise if the item described is whirring robobellboy]Bellomatic 4000[otherwise if the item described is wheeled robobellboy]Peon Unit 4.0[otherwise if the item described is speedy robobellboy]BellTron 58[otherwise]BellTron 001[end if]' are printed directly onto its metal chassis, which has a seam running straight down the centre, allowing it to open up like a door. It has two bulging [']eyes['], which glow faintly as it hobbles around noisily on clumsy mechanical legs. You can occasionally hear small bits of radio feedback from the dimpled antennae on top, which seem to correspond with tiny micro-movements of its oversized, accordion-like torso.".

To set up (M - a robobellboy):
	reset M;
	now the monstersetup of M is 1;
	now the target-room of M is the location of a random on-stage hotel bed;
	now the difficulty of M is 5;
	now the health of M is the maxhealth of M.

To decide which room is the nearest patron:
	let D be 100;
	let H be Hotel01;
	repeat with B running through hotel bed:[wouldn't it be better to search outward through nearby rooms until we find the closest bed? Selkie's thought: normally not, but I recall there's some inbuilt shortest-route finder functionality offered by inform, and that should be fast. See http://inform7.com/learn/man/WI_6_14.html] [Aika: I'm pretty sure that assessing the shortest route of every single room until we find one with a brothel bed would take longer on average than just checking the shortest route of each brothel bed, which is what we do at the moment.]
		let N be the distance of the location of B;
		if N < D and N >= 0:
			now H is the location of B;
			now D is N;
	decide on H.

This is the spawn initial robobellboy rule:
	if the number of alive robobellboys is 0:
		if debugmode > 0, say "Summoning bellboy in hotel.";
		let M be a random robobellboy;
		while M is senior robobellboy:[never the first one to spawn.]
			now M is a random robobellboy;
		summon M in the hotel.
The spawn initial robobellboy rule is listed in the setting up hotel monsters rules.

Part 3 - Combat

Section 1 - Attack

The latex punishment rule of a robobellboy is usually the no latex punishment rule.

The unique punishment rule of a robobellboy is usually the robobellboy punishment rule.
This is the robobellboy punishment rule:
	if the player is immobile:
		say "[one of][BigNameDesc of current-monster] waits beside you patiently.[or][cycling]";
	otherwise if there is a worn messed knickers:

		compute whore forcing of current-monster;
	otherwise:
		compute clothes forcing of current-monster;
	rule succeeds.

	otherwise:
		compute clothes forcing of M.

To compute maid forcing of (M - a robobellboy):
	[One day I want to code a unique punishment for maids, once I've thought of a good one.]
	compute whore forcing of M.[Selkie says: I think it might be fun if the bellboy drags the player through the hotel, forcing them to clean up all the dirty floors with their tongue][Selkie thinks a scene where you're dragged through to polish and clean various parts of the hotel would be fun. It could choose randomly between lovingly cleaning the dildo seat, the modification machine, the hypno screens, the dominatrix's X-frame, the toilets, ... polishing the cocks of the robots, cleaning the portal and then being dragged away before you could use it to escape. Just humiliating scenes. Maybe one where you have to wash a dirty patron, or make the bed or wash the semen-stained sheets from one of the rooms. Let me know if you'd like me to write them. You'd either need to select only rooms visited, or else say they're dragged so quickly from room to room they can't remember the confusing turns that got them to places they hadn't visited.] [Aika: Dragging code automatically works out a path and then flags all the rooms along that path as discovered, so the turns aren't that confusing.]

To compute whore forcing of (M - a robobellboy):
	now the target-room of M is the location of a random on-stage hotel bed;

	if C is unique, decide no;
	if C is ridiculously low cut or lower and diaper quest is 0, decide yes;
	if C is breast covering and C is actually sheer, decide yes;
	decide no.

[You could put a test for "the number of worn breast covering clothing is 0" in here as the first test, but it's not necessary since "actual summonable clothing" checks to see if there's anything worn there.]
To compute bra forcing of (M - a robobellboy):

To compute failed forcing of (M - a robobellboy):

bellboy-forced-bed is a diaper punishment. The priority of bellboy-forced-bed is 2.

	if current-monster is not robobellboy, decide no;
	if the player is immobile, decide no;
	[if the cringe appearance of the player < 5, decide no;]
	decide yes.

To compute punishment of (P - bellboy-forced-bed):
	compute whore forcing of current-monster.

bellboy-forced-clothing is a diaper punishment. The priority of bellboy-forced-clothing is 3.
Definition: a bellboy-forced-clothing (called P) is appropriate:
	if current-monster is not robobellboy, decide no;
