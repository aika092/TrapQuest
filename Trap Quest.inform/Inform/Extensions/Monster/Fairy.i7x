[Selkie: a thought: this code looks (to my meagre understanding) like the fairies are pretty unstoppable. Unless you can kill them in one hit? But you could instead allow something like the maid's spray bottle to be especially effective, and able to prevent their attack that around, if you squirt them with it, and if you succeed twice in a row, perhaps have that drive them off?  And you might do a similar thing with a slap attack: "You swat at the fairy, and make contact, which seems to upset her!" - and maybe a couple of those could have them buzz off?  Just an idea.]

[Of course, 'current-monster' here is the blue fairy]
This is the blue fairy powerup rule:
	repeat with N running through dangerous monsters in the location of the player:
		if N is not current-monster and the refactory-period of current-monster <= 0 and the health of N < the maxhealth of N:
			say "The [current-monster] floats over the [N], giggling as she sprinkles glittering blue fairy dust over [his of N] head. [big he of N] shakes [his of N] head as all of [his of N] wounds close simultaneously.";
			now the health of N is the maxhealth of N;
			now the refactory-period of current-monster is 200;
			bore current-monster for 120 seconds;
			rule succeeds.
The blue fairy powerup rule is listed first in the fairy attacks then gets bored rules.
