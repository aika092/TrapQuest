RoboMaid by Monster begins here.

A robomaid is a kind of robot. A robomaid is usually intelligent. Understand "maid", "robomaid" as robomaid. The leftover-type of a robomaid is usually 127.

[The robomaid does the following things:
	punishment:
		If you're dirty, she drags you to the laundry room
		If you're naked, she drags you to the nearest robobellboy
		otherwise, it's time for a "publicity stunt"
			she has a sloppy kissing session w/ you

	Patrons will periodically pass through the room the player is in and make a mess.
	If the robomaid is in the room with a patron at any time, she services them in some way and it makes a mess
