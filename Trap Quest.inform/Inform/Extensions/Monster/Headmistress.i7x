[big his of M] ass has been made more easily accessible with the addition of a very long ankle spreader bar, which keeps [his of M] feet over a metre apart from each other at all times. A tally has been started on [his of M] right inner thigh. Looks like [he of M]'s been fucked at least five times already. One ear has been pierced and a large 'SLUT' tag added. [big his of M] wrists are cuffed behind [him of M], leaving [him of M] absolutely powerless to stop anyone using [him of M] as they please. [big his of M] tongue is stuck out of [his of M] mouth with a lewd expression. You watch as [he of M] instinctively tries to draw it back into [his of M] mouth, but then [his of M] 'SLUT' tag flutters wildly as [his of M] earring gives [him of M] a painful electric shock.

[big his of M] entrance has been made even more easily accessible with the addition of a very long ankle spreader bar, which keeps [his of M] feet over a metre apart from each other at all times.

It's clear from the bulkiness between [his of M] legs that [he of M]'s well padded under [his of M] new onesie. [one of]More curious, however, is the fact that [he of M]'s keeping [his of M] feet over a metre apart for no clear reason. But then you[or]You[stopping] watch as [he of M] instinctively moves [his of M] feet a little closer together, but then [his of M] fists clench and [his of M] legs shudder wildly as [his of M] high heels give [him of M] painful electric shocks.

A tight red latex dress with a very deep V-neck clings tightly to [him of M], allowing you to appreciate all of [his of M] curves. The dress, although very provocative and not reaching below mid-thigh, somehow gives [him of M] an aura of extreme dominance. This sensation is further enhanced by [his of M] straight neat jet black hair and harsh make up which gives [his of M] face a rather... fierce appearance.".
