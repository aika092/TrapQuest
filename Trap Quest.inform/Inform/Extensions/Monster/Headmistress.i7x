Our curriculum is staged to make sure you aren't exposed to anything too... disturbing... until you have proven yourself capable of accepting it.[paragraph break]'Now listen closely, the way this school works is as follows. You [bold type]attend a lesson[speech style of M] by entering the classroom that matches your student rank, which is indicated by the font of the writing on your armband. There is usually a [bold type]minor positive benefit[speech style of M] to attending any class, because, well, experience is the best teacher. Of course, there may be other side-effects depending on your choices. Students who perform well in a lesson can be [bold type]promoted to the next rank.[speech style of M] You will have to prove yourself if you want to raise your ranking and earn access to more of the school. Now, after attending at least one lesson, you will be free to [bold type]go back through the portal in reception[speech style of M] and spend some more time outside of the school grounds, giving you more time to think on what you've learned, and grow accustomed to the world around you. This is recommended, because [bold type]entering advanced lessons before you're ready for them can be rather overwhelming[speech style of M]. When you're out in the big wide world, your armband notifies you when the other students have arrived and your next lesson is waiting to begin. You get four warnings. If you hear a fifth alarm tone, when you return to the school [bold type]you will be put in detention for being late[speech style of M], and my staff will begin to hunt you down and enforce your return.[paragraph break][if the player is the donator]'Another reason to return to the real world in between lessons is that you can only access the Extra Credit Zone once in a while. You can't just wait in the school until you're allowed in again, because time works a bit differently here. [bold type]To access the Extra Credit Zone you must first spend time outside the school until your armband beeps at least once, and then attend at least one normal lesson, [speech style of M]and then when you enter the Warp Portal to leave the school, you will be offered the opportunity to enter the Extra Credit Zone. When you successfully complete your Extra Credit Mission, you will be rewarded with (amongst other things) a bracelet. The value of the bracelet will match your rank as a student. Since you can only wear two bracelets at once, if you already have two, and you plan to enter the Extra Credit Zone, [bold type]it is best to spend or trade at least one of your bracelets before returning to the school.[speech style of M][paragraph break][end if]'Now let me take a closer look at you...
