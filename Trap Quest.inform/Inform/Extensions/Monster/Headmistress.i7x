A presumably new tattoo sits above [his of M] [sissy-penis], with the words 'Enter in Rear' and an arrow pointing toward his butt. His ass has been made more easily accessible with the addition of a very long ankle spreader bar, which keeps his feet over a metre apart from each other at all times. A tally has been started on his right inner thigh. Looks like he's been fucked at least five times already. One ear has been pierced and a large 'SLUT' tag added. His wrists are cuffed behind him, leaving him absolutely powerless to stop anyone using him as they please. His tongue is stuck out of hos mouth with a lewd expression. You watch as he instinctively tries to draw it back into his mouth, but then hos 'SLUT' tag flutters wildly as his earring gives her a painful electric shock. He whimpers and returns to sticking his tongue as far out of his mouth as he can.";

			say "[BigNameDesc of M][']s dress has been opened further at the front, including a big slit in the skirt section right in front of her bare pussy. A presumably new tattoo sits above her slit, with the words 'Fuck Here' and an arrow pointing at her undefended fuckhole. Her entrance has been made even more easily accessible with the addition of a very long ankle spreader bar, which keeps her feet over a metre apart from each other at all times. A tally has been started on her right inner thigh. Looks like she's been fucked at least five times already. One ear has been pierced and a large 'SLUT' tag added.

	otherwise if M is diaper-enslaved:
		say "[BigNameDesc of M][']s red dress has been replaced by a heart-themed red onesie with cute pale frills at the shoulders. Matching pale red ribbons keep her jet black hair in pigtails and make her look a lot less fierce than she used to. Long red latex thigh-highs complete the adorable look. It's clear from the bulkiness between her legs that she's well padded under her new onesie. [one of]More curious, however, is the fact that she's keeping her feet over a metre apart for no clear reason. But then you[or]You[stopping] watch as she instinctively moves her feet a little closer together, but then her fists clench and her legs shudder wildly as her high heels give her painful electric shocks. She whimpers and returns to holding her feet as far apart as she can.";
	otherwise:
		say "This [man of M] looks almost ageless - [he of M]'s clearly an adult but you can't tell if [he of M]'s 20 or 40. [big his of M] very slim figure is complemented by [if lady fetish is 2]a perfectly sculpted chin and a thick, grabbable butt[otherwise]perfect D cup breasts and not insignificant hips[end if]. A tight red latex dress with a very deep V-neck clings tightly to [him of M], allowing you to appreciate all of [his of M] curves. The dress, although very provocative and not reaching below mid-thigh, somehow gives [him of M] an aura of extreme dominance. This sensation is further enhanced by [his of M] straight neat jet black hair and harsh make up which gives [his of M] face a rather... fierce appearance.".

To say MonsterComment of (M - headmistress):
	say "[variable custom style]It's like I can actually feel raw power coming from her. [if the bimbo of the player <= 10]I need to be careful[otherwise]I'd better do whatever she says[end if].[roman type][line break]".

[big his of N] belly stretches to contain all the [semen]. After [he of N] is full, [he of M] tosses [him of N] to the ground, where [he of N] promptly faints[otherwise]transforming[end if].";
	otherwise say "You hear a [man of N] screech [line break][speech style of N]'That fucking [ShortDesc of ex-princess] had one of these roaming [his of ex-princess] lands?!'[roman type][line break][if N is nearby]nearby, [otherwise]somewhere in the region, [end if] followed by a wail of shame.";
