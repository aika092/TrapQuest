hypno-lesson is a lesson. The lesson-teacher of hypno-lesson is teacher-hyacinthe.
hypno-lesson has a number called traitor-hypno.

Definition: hypno-lesson (called L) is lesson-appropriate:
	if the player is not an april 2019 top donator, decide no;
	if chess-lesson is appropriate, decide no; [Chess lesson is way better at the moment]
	decide yes.

To compute teaching of (L - hypno-lesson):
	let M be lesson-teacher of L;
	let STN be the number of students in the location of the player;
	let ST be a random student in the location of the player;
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] sits on the ground, legs crossed. Several candles surround the edges of the room, providing the only light. [if STN > 1]The other students are also sitting cross-legged, in a semi-circle in front of [him of M]. [big he of M] beckons you to come join them[otherwise if STN is 1][BigNameDesc of ST] is sitting to [his of M] left, also cross-legged.

[']breathing exercises[']. Come, sit with me, close your eyes, and listen to my voice.'[roman type][line break]The air in the room is heavy, and this, combined with your closed eyes and [NameDesc of M][']s hypnotic humming, quickly takes you into a deep trance.

(If you do, you imagine you probably won't get promoted.) ";
	if the player is consenting:
		say "[second custom style]I won't betray my friends.[roman type][paragraph break]You open your eyes to find that [NameDesc of M] is staring directly at you, smiling gently, but with something cold in [his of M] eyes.[line break][speech style of M]'Disappointing.'[roman type][line break]";

		now the armband-title of armband is "Scarlet";
		now the armband-print of armband is "scandal";
		say ExamineDesc of armband;
	repeat with S running through students in the location of the player:
		say "[BigNameDesc of M] turns to [NameDesc of S].";
		if S is promotable:
			say "[speech style of M]'You've done well today, [student-name of S].'[roman type][line break]";
			promote S;
		otherwise if S is demotable and armband is pure diamond:
			say "[big he of S] looks terrified.[line break][speech style of S]'No, this is wrong, this is so wrong[one of]! I won't wanna... I can't remember what, but I know it's bad[or][stopping]!'[roman type][line break][big he of S] looks at you.[line break][speech style of S]'What have you let [him of M] do to you?!'[roman type][line break]";
