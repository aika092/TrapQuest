You feel a little more confident in yourself knowing you can find such fine food around here.[otherwise]The taste is beyond incredible, and you feel lucky and important for a chance to taste such fine food.[end if] [if the flesh volume of arms > 7] and a lot more fat[otherwise if weight gain fetish is 1]You also feel a little chubbier.[otherwise]You also feel pretty full[end if]".[you cannot fully enjoy a truffle if you eat too fast!]

Carry out TQeating truffle:
	say "[DevourFlav of the noun]";
	if the quality of the noun <= (diaper quest - 2):
		if diaper quest is 1:
			say "The rich chocolate leaves you feeling really satisfied, but you're sure that there was a secret ingredient in it, because as soon as you're finished eating,";
			if diaper lover >= a random number between 3 and 5:
				say "your bowels rumble worryingly!";
				increase suppository by 1;
			otherwise:
				say "you feel a weird numbness in your bladder!";
				increase incontinence by 1;
		otherwise:
			say "The rich chocolate leaves you feeling really satisfied, but it's impossible to let go of the knowledge that someone definitely came in your food.";
			if the semen taste addiction of the player > 8:
				say "[second custom style]I wish all food could be like this...[roman type]";
				SemenAddictUp 2;
			otherwise if a random number between the intelligence of the player and 5 < 6:
				say "In fact, it's hard not to associate the taste of the truffle with the taste of [semen].";
			otherwise:
				say "[first custom style]I'm so disgusting. I can[']t believe I really ate that...[roman type]";
				SemenAddictUp 1;
				Humiliate 125;
			Arouse the semen taste addiction of the player * 20;	
			StomachSemenUp 1;
	otherwise if a random number between 3 and the quality of the noun is 3:
		say "The rich chocolate leaves you feeling really satisfied, and you feel like you could put up with a lot as long as you still feel that great taste in the back of your mouth";
		increase truffle-confidence-timer by 200 + the quality of the noun * 10 + the fat of the noun * 30;
	otherwise:
		say "The rich chocolate leaves you feeling really satisfied, but you know you can't trust anything good from this game.";

	if truffle-confidence-timer > 0:
		decrease truffle-confidence-timer by time-seconds;
