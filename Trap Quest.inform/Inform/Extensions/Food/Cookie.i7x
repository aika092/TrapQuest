			now the stomach-water of the player is 1;
	otherwise if the quality of the noun is -2:
		say "You start feeling a bit woozy as the food settles in your stomach, and you realize [semen] may not have been the only dubious ingredient. It suddenly feels a lot harder to move your muscles. [if the semen addiction of the player < 7][line break][variable custom style]Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse[otherwise]At least I got to taste some [semen][end if]![roman type][line break]";
		increase cookie-poison-timer by default-candy-duration + the fat of the noun * 5;
