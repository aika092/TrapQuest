Quests by Clothing begins here.

A clothing-quest is a kind of object.

A clothing-quest can be disappearing or persistent. A clothing-quest is usually disappearing. [Disappearing quests offer to let the player have the item instantly vanish when the quest is completed and only ever trigger once. Persistent quests don't offer to have the item vanish, they just uncurse or bless the item. They can be triggered multiple times.]

A clothing-quest has a number called quest-completions. [counts the number of times a quest has been completed.]

A headgear-clothing-quest is a kind of clothing-quest. A headgear-clothing-quest is persistent. [Headgear don't disappear instantly when the class quest is completed.]

To decide which number is the total-quest-weighting of (C - a clothing): [In order to use the weightings to choose a random quest, we need to know the sum of the weighting of all quests]
	let N be 0;
	repeat with Q running through clothing-quests:
		increase N by the actual-quest-weighting of Q for C;
	decide on N.

To decide which clothing-quest is the random-quest of (C - a clothing): [Choose a quest at random, using their weightings]

	decide on N.

To decide which clothing-quest is the random-persistent-quest of (C - a clothing): [Choose a persistent quest at random, using their weightings]
	let R be a random number between 1 and the total-persistent-quest-weighting of C;
