Cringe by Clothing begins here.

[Cringe is the ABDL version of outrage. How much does it make the player seem like a little rather than a grownup.]

To decide which number is the cringe of (C - an object):
	decide on 0.

To decide which number is the cringe of (C - a wearthing):
	if C is worn:
		if C is not currently at least partially visible, decide on 0;
	decide on the unworn cringe of C.

To decide which number is the unworn cringe of (C - a clothing):
	if C is messed knickers, decide on 20;
	let O be the initial cringe of C;
	if C is worn currently visible clothing, increase O by the fluid cringe of C;
	if C is worn currently visible knickers, increase O by 3; [Having one's knickers exposed is very childlike.]
	if O > 20, now O is 20;
	decide on O.

To decide which number is the initial cringe of (C - a thing):
	decide on 0. [Default assumption is that it is not childish.]

Definition: a clothing (called C) is too adult:
	if the bimbo of the player > 7 and the cringe of C + 7 is not too humiliating and the cringe of C < 11 and C is actually dense and C is not super-short and C is not short, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is almost too cringeworthy:
	if the cringe of C + 2 is too humiliating and the cringe of C > 0, decide yes;
	decide no.


Cringe ends here.
