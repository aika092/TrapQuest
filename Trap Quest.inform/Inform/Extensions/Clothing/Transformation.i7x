Transformation by Clothing begins here.


clothing has an object called upgrade-target.
clothing has a number called transform-attempts.
clothing has a number called transform-resistance.
A game universe initialisation rule:
	repeat with C running through rare clothing:
		increase the transform-resistance of C by 1.

To decide which object is the potential-upgrade-target of (C - a clothing):
	[THIS IS THE TEMPLATE FOR FINDING THE BEST TRANSFORMATION TARGET.]
	now theme-share-target is C;
	let Z be nothing;
	let L1 be the list of off-stage same-type transformation-eligible fetish appropriate more-outrageous clothing; [Find all items that could be reasonable transformation targets.]
	if debugmode > 1, say "[number of entries in L1] eligible transformation items found.";
	if the number of entries in L1 > 0:
		let L2 be a list of clothing;
		now Z is entry 1 of L1; [If every item is transformation-theme-blocked, we still spit out an item so that the 'is upgradable' function works as intended.]
		repeat with D running through L1:
			now the upgrade-target of C is D;
			if C is not transformation-theme-blocked:
				add D to L2; [Disregard ones that the item will refuse to transform into.]
		if debugmode > 1:
			say "Final list is ";
			repeat with D running through L2:
				say "[D] ";
			say line break;
		sort L2 in random order; [Otherwise whatever happens to be the lower object ID in the game's memory would always take priority over other items with the same eligibility]
		let O be 100;
		repeat with D running through L2: [Find the least outrageous of the eligible transformation items. Hopefully makes the choices follow a nice sequence.]
			let IO be the initial outrage of D;
			if IO < O:
				if debugmode > 1, say "[ShortDesc of D] has initial outrage [IO], which is lower than [O].";
				now Z is D;
				now O is IO;
	decide on Z.

[If this resolves to something other than nothing, it will override the above.]
To decide which object is the unique-upgrade-target of (C - a clothing):
	decide on nothing.

To update upgrade target of (C - a clothing):
	now the upgrade-target of C is nothing;
	now the upgrade-target of C is the unique-upgrade-target of C;
	if C is not class-transformation-protected and the upgrade-target of C is nothing, now the upgrade-target of C is the potential-upgrade-target of C;
	check upgrade target of C.

To check upgrade target of (C - a clothing):
	if the upgrade-target of C is clothing and C is worn:
		if debugmode > 1, say "Checking if [upgrade-target of C] can be summoned when [C] is not worn.";
		let L be the list of body parts penetrated by C;
		repeat with B running through L:
			now C is not penetrating B;
		now C is in Holding Pen; [We want to see if the upgrade-target of C is wearable so we can't have it being worn or penetrating orifices while we do that]
		if the upgrade-target of C is not actually summonable:
			now the upgrade-target of C is nothing;
			if debugmode > 1, say "It was not summonable.";
		repeat with B running through L:
			now C is penetrating B;
		now C is worn by the player.

Definition: an object is untransformable: decide yes. ['Nothing' is untransformable.]

Definition: a clothing is transformation-protected: decide no. [Some stuff doesn't get transformed while it is in a certain state.]

Definition: a clothing is disintegration-protected if it is class-transformation-protected. [Some stuff doesn't get transformed while it has nothing to turn into.]

Definition: a clothing is class-transformation-protected: decide no. [Some stuff doesn't get transformed while it has no other class relevant items to transform into.]

Definition: a clothing is transformation-theme-blockable if it is not class-transformation-protected. [Some stuff refuses to transform when it shares a theme with other items. Class items will always transform into a more slutty class item though, regardless of theme.]

Definition: a clothing (called C) is transformation-theme-blocked:
	if C is not transformation-theme-blockable, decide no;
	now theme-target is C;
	now colour-themes-shared is 0;
	now interesting-themes-shared is 0;
	truncate colour-themes-shared-list to 0 entries;
	truncate interesting-themes-shared-list to 0 entries;
	follow the theme blocking rules;
	if colour-themes-shared + interesting-themes-shared > 0, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is untransformable:
	if C is transformation-protected, decide yes;
	if C is disintegration-protected:
		if C is not loop-safe-upgradable, decide yes; [Traps will never even bother trying to transform something disintegration-protected that hasn't been able to find a successful transformation target this turn.]
	decide no.

Definition: a clothing is transformable if it is not untransformable.


Definition: an equippable is transformation-protected: decide yes.

Definition: a thing is end of transformation chain: decide no.

Definition: a thing is transformation chain if it is not end of transformation chain.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is upgradable:
	if the upgrade-target of C is clothing:
		if C is untransformable, decide no;
		decide yes; [this means we've already worked out that it's upgradable this turn, we don't want to re-check and possibly have RNG decide it's not actually upgradable, so we don't update the target]
	update upgrade target of C;
	if C is untransformable, decide no;
	if the upgrade-target of C is clothing, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is loop-safe-upgradable:
	if the upgrade-target of C is clothing, decide yes;
	update upgrade target of C;
	if the upgrade-target of C is clothing, decide yes;
	decide no.

To compute (C - a clothing) inheriting from (D - a clothing):
	if D is cursed:
		now C is cursed;
	otherwise if D is blessed:
		now C is blessed;
	otherwise:
		now C is bland;

	if D is crotch-unzipped and C is crotch-zipped, ZipDown C;
	if D is crotch-ripped and (C is crotch-intact or C is crotch-zipped or C is crotch-skirted), now C is crotch-ripped;
	if D is messed knickers and C is soilable knickers:
		now the mess of C is the mess of D;
		if D is diaper and C is diaper, now the perceived-mess of C is the perceived-mess of D;
	if C is fluid vulnerable and the soak-limit of D > 0:

	now the used condoms of C is the used condoms of D;

	now the quest of C is the quest of D;
	compute C unique inheriting from D.

To compute (C - a clothing) unique inheriting from (D - a clothing):
	do nothing.

To transform (D - a clothing) into (C - a clothing):
	say "[bold type]Your [ShortDesc of D] transforms into ";
	silently transform D into C;
