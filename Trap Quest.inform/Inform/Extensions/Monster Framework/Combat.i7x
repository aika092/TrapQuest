Combat by Monster Framework begins here.

current-monster is a monster that varies.

To check attack of (M - a monster):
	if M is threatening or M is penetrating a body part or M is grabbing the player:
		now the alert of the player is 1;
		if M is delayed:
			compute correct delay of M;
		otherwise if the paralyze-status of M > 0:
			now the last-interaction of M is 1;
			decrease the paralyze-status of M by 1;
			compute paralysis of M;
		otherwise:
			compute attack of M.

To compute correct delay of (M - a monster): [Default behaviour of delayed monster]
	if diaper quest is 1, compute DQ delay of M;
	otherwise compute delay of M.

To compute DQ delay of (M - a monster):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] doesn't do anything, as if waiting to see what you do next.".

To compute delay of (M - a monster):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] doesn't do anything, as if waiting to see what you do next.".

To compute paralysis of (M - a monster):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] [if the paralyze-status of M > 0]doesn't seem able to move[otherwise]can move again[end if]!";

To compute attack of (M - a monster):
	now current-monster is M;
	if the poison-status of M > 0 and health of M > 1:
		let N be the maxhealth of M / 10;
		if N < 1, now N is 1;
		decrease health of M by N;
		if health of M < 1:
			now health of M is 1;
		decrease the poison-status of M by 1;
	follow the monster attack rules.

The monster attack rules is a rulebook.
[In each rule in this rulebook, we write 'if the rule succeeded, rule succeeds.'  In this way rule succeeds is used for finishing up completely. Rule fails is used for exiting a rulebook and moving to the next rulebook in the sex rules. Obviously if a rulebook ends with neither, then we also continue as if we had encountered a rule fails.]


To MonsterStomp (M - a monster):
	let stomped be 0;
	repeat with N running through undefeated awake monsters in the location of M:
		if stomped is 0 and N is not penetrating a body part and N is not grabbing the player and N is not M:
			compute M stomping N;
			now stomped is 1.

[To compute (M - a monster) stomping (N - a monster): Consider this a template!
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] kills the [N]!";
	destroy N;
	let L be a random off-stage leftover;
	now L is in the location of M;
	now the leftover-type of L is the leftover-type of N.]

To compute (M - a monster) stomping (N - a monster):[We keep this completely generic to avoid potential conflicts with the specific instances of each monster.]
	if N is female and N is not neuter:
		if M is in the location of the player, say "[BigNameDesc of M] grabs [NameDesc of N] and pulls [him of N] towards [him of M]. Remaining fully standing, [he of M] lowers [him of N] onto [his of M] giant erect [DickDesc of M] and starts fucking [his of N] [HoleDesc of N] furiously. [big he of N] screams in both pleasure and terror as [his of M] member almost splits [him of N] in two, and very soon [he of M] is coming inside [him of N]. [big his of N] belly visibly bulges before pints of [semen] begin to explode from around the sides of [his of M] [DickDesc of M]. After [he of M] has finished, [his of M] tail lets go of [his of N] waist and [he of N] falls to the ground, where [he of N] promptly faints.";
		otherwise say "You hear a [man of N] shout out in a mixture of ecstasy and terror from [if N is nearby]nearby[otherwise]somewhere in the [playerRegion][end if]!";
		destroy N;
		let L be a random off-stage leftover;
		now L is in the location of M;
		now the leftover-type of L is the leftover-type of N;
	otherwise:
		say "[BigNameDesc of M] is glitching, it doesn't know how to deal with the [N]. Report this bug please!";[This will not happen with default game but with added monsters it allows the ability for them to be dungeon dwelling and have a scene where the minotaur kills them.]


Chapter 1 Continue and Finish Sex

		orgasm current-monster;
		rule succeeds.
The default finish sex rule is listed last in the default continue sex rules.

[The following rules should be considered BLAND EXAMPLES and if they are called during runtime that is bad because they are boring. Replace either the compute clauses, or the entire end of sex rulebook for any monster you create.]

	now the chosen-orifice of current-monster is nothing.
The reset chosen orifice rule is listed first in the default end-of-sex rules.

[!<OrgasmMonster>+

	if the player is desperate to drink semen, decide yes;
	if a random number between 10 and 20 < the delicateness of the player, decide yes;
	decide no.

[!<ComputeFacialClimaxOfMonster>+

This function handles the oral "climax" of a monster. By default, this can end in one of four ways. First, a resisting player can escape at the last second, avoiding semen on their face or in their mouth, which should trigger the angry punishment function for this monster. Second, the monster can ejaculate on the player's face. Third, the monster can ejaculate in the player's mouth, prompting them to swallow. If they don't, we should call the angry punishment function. Fourth, the monster can deepthroat the player so they swallow automatically

		if M is interested, satisfy M;[dislodges him automatically]
		otherwise dislodge M.

[!<ComputeClimaxOfMonsterInFuckhole>+

This function handles the climax of a monster (M) in a given fuckhole (F). First we call TimesSubmittedUp for M, then we look at the "unique climax" for M in F, which may be replaced with special functionality depending on the monster. The post climax effect handles anything that should happen after the climax has happened, specific to that monster. Lastly, we dislodge the monster after making sure that the monster actually needs to be dislodged(some monsters might want to go for another round after they climax, and other monsters may have their own rules for making the monster pull out.) Satisfy M makes the monster forgive the player and calls the "dislodge M" function by default.

[
Tripping rolls:
In general, when checking if a monster trips the player, do this:
Say that the monster is trying to trip the player
Set the monster's tripping roll as a value, we'll use T here
*If the monster is a DECENT TRIPPER, use if the tripping roll of M >= the dexterity of the player to confirm successful trip*
*Otherwise use if the tripping roll of M > the dexterity of the player*
**Further modifications can obviously be made with + and - flat numbers**
**Be aware that text lines can come out here about how the slipperiness of the room is making it hard to stay on your feet**
If successful, say that the trip was successful and try kneeling.
Otherwise say that it was unsuccessful.

[The trip roll is usually (difficulty / 2) to difficulty. The number it's rolling against is dex]
To decide which number is the tripping roll of (M - a monster):

		if debuginfo > 1, say "[input-style]This is lower than dex ([D]), so tripping has minimum likelihood of [if the remainder after dividing D by 2 is 1]1 in [(D + 1) / 2][otherwise]2 in [D + 1][end if] (d[D + 1]).[roman type][line break]";
		now T is a random number between 1 and (D + 1);

To decide which number is the tripping max of (M - a monster):
	if attack-type is 0 or attack-type is 1:
		if the trip hazard of the player <= 0, decide on 0;
		otherwise decide on 1; [if the player slapped or stood still they are not off-balance so tripping is always minimum likelihood]
	if the living belt of sturdiness is worn and the living belt of sturdiness is not cursed, decide on 0;
	let D be the difficulty of M;
	increase D by the trip hazard of the player * 2;
	if the slipperiness of the location of the player > 0, say "The slipperiness of the floor is making it much more difficult to avoid falling!";
	if attack-type is 3, now D is D * 2;
	if D < 1, decide on 1;
	decide on D.

To decide which number is the accuracy roll of (M - a monster):
	let D be the difficulty of M + (a random number between 1 and 6) + (a random number between 1 and 6);
	if D > the difficulty of M + 7, now D is 9999; [This check means that the right hand side of the normal distribution roll always is a successful hit. i.e. 50% of the time, the monster will hit automatically]
	if the blind-status of M > 0, now D is (the difficulty of M + (a random number between 0 and 6) + (a random number between 0 and 6)) / 2; [If the monster is blinded then we ignore the 50% minimum hit chance and also nerf accuracy massively]
	if debugmode is 1, say "Player [dexterity of the player] | [D].5 [ShortDesc of M][line break]";
	decide on D.


A monster has a number called last-tripped.

Definition: a jismbodied ghost is a tripper: decide yes.

This is the choice of attack rule:
	if current-monster is a tripper:
		let TC be 10;
		if the trophy-mode of trip-trophy is 1 and there is worn heels, now TC is 5;
		if the last-tripped of current-monster > a random number between 1 and TC or (tutorial is 1 and the last-tripped of current-monster is 2):
