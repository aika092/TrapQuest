Dominating Monsters by Monster Framework begins here.

Definition: a monster is permanently banishable: [Can't be summoned again once banished]
	if it is intelligent, decide yes;

	if M is in the location of the player and notebook is worn, compute studying 1 of M;
	if the health of M <= 0, compute defeat reward of M; [so this doesn't include when an NPC banishes themselves, e.g. sex dolls detonating]

To say BanishDropFlav of (C - a thing) from (M - a monster):
	say "[BigNameDesc of M] left [NameDesc of C] behind.".

To compute defeat reward of (M - a monster):
	if the player is not broken:
		let H be the humiliation of the player;
		let D be 1000 + (the difficulty of M * 100);
		if D > H / 10, now D is H / 10; [you can't heal more than 10% of humiliation at once.]
		if D < 800, now D is 800; [unless humiliation is less than 8000]
		dignify D;
		if the humiliation of the player is 0, say "You feel very satisfied and proud of yourself[if H > 0]. In fact you feel like you respect yourself just as much as you did when you first entered the game[end if].";

[!<DomMonster>+

The health of the monster should be set to above zero so the game doesn't immediately destroy it. The monster should also have their location changed so the player can't just one-hit them after.

@deprecated This function represents the old "fuck" framework, where the player would automatically get the chance to have sex with a defeated female monster when their health reached zero. The fact that it was a guarantee meant that the reward the player got had to be rather small, and a considerable drawback always had to come with it.

+!]
To dom (M - a monster):
	say "[if the player is possessing a penis]You use [NameDesc of M] as your own personal cocksleeve! Then [he of M] runs away, humiliated and angry.[otherwise]You finger-bang [NameDesc of M] into submission. [big he of M] runs away, humiliated and angry.[end if]".

[DOMINANT SEX FRAMEWORK]

[!<DominateUpMonster>+

This function increments the times-dominated value for M, then increments dominated-count for the player. This allows the game to keep track of how many times the player has dominated a monster, and how many monsters the player has dominated overall.

@param <Monster>:<M> The monster the player dominated

+!]
To DominateUp (M - a monster):
	increase the times-dominated of M by 1;
	increase the dominated-count of the player by 1;
	increase the sex-count of the player by 1.

[!<playerFucking:Integer>*

The DOMINANT-NONE is always 0.
The DOMINANT-FAILURE is always 1.
The DOMINANT-SHAMEFUL is always 2.
The DOMINANT-NEUTRAL is always 3.
The DOMINANT-DOMINANT is always 4.
The DOMINANT-SUPER is always 5.

[!<playerFuckChoice:Integer>*

Determines what type of sex the player is currently attempting to have.
-3 - Watersports
-2 - Sex
-1 - Blowjob
0 - nothing
1 - facesitting
2 - not conventional sex
3 - Cowgirl

*!]

Player-fucker is a body part that varies.

Dominating is an action applying to one thing.

[!<CheckDominating>+

This functions determines whether we let the player try to dominate a monster, and sets things up for the actual attempt. Players that have a penis and players who are wearing strapons have an option to use those on monsters. Players also have an option to use either their vagina (female players) or their asshole (male players). If the player has no penis or no strapon, then it defaults to one of those two. Once we know what the player will be using to dominate the monster, we perform some more specific checks to make sure that the player is actually able to use that properly. NOTE: if the player has a chastity item on, then they won't be able to use a penis for sex, even if it's not directly attached to their body

[!<CarryOutDominating>+

This function handles a player's attempt to dominate a given monster. Dominant sex is controlled by a value called player-fucking. This value manipulates a couple things in the Orgasm extension, but mostly we use it here. if player-fucking is DOMINANT-FAILURE, it means the player failed to dominate the monster. If it's DOMINANT-DOMINANT, if means the player succeeded. If it's DOMINANT-NONE, it means we don't know yet.

We start off with a check to see if the monster in question is over 50% hp or if the player has max delicateness, which is an automatic failure.
IF we can't determine anything with that, we use a special function called DecideWhichNumberIsTheSubmissivenessOfMonster, which outputs either 1 or -1 depending on a couple factors.
Now that we have the result, we diverge.
IF THE PLAYER SUCCEEDED, we output some flavour text describing the monster and the player having sex. In general, if the player uses their penis/strapon for sex, big penis is good, small penis is bad. If the player uses a fuckhole for sex and the monster has a penis, the player will usually ride on top of them and then have some choice at the end of the scene, depending on a couple factors. Otherwise, the player will sit on a monster's face, which probably won't get the player an orgasm, but it has few drawbacks. Once the scene has been displayed, we apply any rewards for dominant sex. These rewards vary depending on the monster and any specific events that may have happened in the scene. Once we're done, we send the monster somewhere else so the player can't immediately attack them again, although this isn't actually a big problem, since they'll instantly be at full health after it's over. It is not necessary to make the monster lose interest after a successful dominance scene, and in the case of male monsters that fuck the player, it can be inadvisable, since it makes it difficult to know whether or not the player used a condom.
IF THE PLAYER FAILED, we output a short piece of flavour where the monster turns the tables. After that, the monster will give the player some sort of unique punishment. In general, these punishments should not be something the player wants to repeat, so the player doesn't use it as an excuse to always weasel out of normal punishments. Note that if the monster has a penis, it's often strictly worse than if the player had just done things the normal way. If the monster is still interested after handling the punishment, it means they ARE going to do things the normal way, so we don't send them anywhere.
AFTER EVERYTHING is said and done, we reset player-fucking to 0.

This function calculates the "dominance score" of the player, which is derived from the player's sex addiction, delicateness, and orifice openness, in addition to penis size and the enchantment types of any pieces of worn clothing. Male players always have an inherent advantage, so we try to compensate a little bit by taking the average gape of both holes for female players. If the player learns the fuckskill, orifice openness and sex addiction are omitted from the calculation.
Selkie: what would add a lot of value to this comment is some concrete examples of dominance values to use.
MG: generally the purpose of this function is to pit it against monsters, so it's more about whether the player's "score" is higher than whatever value we get from the monster

If N is greater than or equal to D, the player wins with no further check. 3rd check: Retry 2nd check. I made a rule during a play-through that I'd accept a failure if I failed again after using undo once, so it felt right to simply include that in the check. 4th check: If M has a maxhealth of 40 or more and their health is 10 or less, retry 2nd check.

This function should usually be called when the player successfully dominates a male monster, such that it completely replaces the normal unique dominance reward. Usual reward is a substantial delicateness decrease. Since there's a possibility of the
player being inseminated during the sex, the player can choose to apply a condom to their partner before the event. If they do, there's no risk of creampie and the player will always get to cum. Skipping the condom obviously brings a risk of a creampie, so to balance it out, one pinned condom will be removed from their clothing, prioritising torn condoms first, then full ones.

[!<SayDominanceFailureOfMonster>+

The text in this function should output whenever the player unsuccessfully dominates a monster. We don't want to include it in any of the failed dominance functions because we'd be writing the same thing over and over.

[!<ComputeFailedDominancePunishmentOfMonster>+

The failed dominance punishment should be implemented for any monster that the player can dominate. This punishment should be fairly light, since winning is a requirement for making a domination attempt. If the monster won't be having sex with the player right after, the punishment can be worse and we should make sure the monster loses interest at the end.

[!<ComputeSissification>+

computeSissification is called whenever the monster doesn't have another punishment for the player, or we weren't satisfied with the monster's normal punishment was light, so we want to make it more intense. It can summon sissy items or increase delicateness, but it could always have some other effects added later. The idea here is that failing to dominate a monster too many times will put the player into a downward spiral that they have trouble recovering from, but that can be avoided by playing smart with your odds. Most punishments from this function should be more on the side of harsh, with small upsides here and there.
