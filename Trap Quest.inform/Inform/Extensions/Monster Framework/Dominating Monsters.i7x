[!<YourselfIsDomLicious>+

Determines whether or not the player can successfully fuck a monster or not.

@deprecated This function determined whether or not the player would actually be presented with the chance to fuck a defeated female npc. Since it's now determined through rng, this function is unneeded.
@return This function returns true if the player is able to fuck the monster. Otherwise, it returns false.

[!<Player>@<dominatedCount:Integer>*

The number of times the player has had dominant sex.

*@!]
The player has a number called dominated-count. The dominated-count of the player is usually 0.

[!<DomMonster>+

The health of the monster should be set to above zero so the game doesn't immediately destroy it. The monster should also have their location changed so the player can't just one-hit them after.

@deprecated This function represents the old "fuck" framework, where the player would automatically get the chance to have sex with a defeated female monster when their health reached zero. The fact that it was a guarantee meant that the reward the player got had to be rather small, and a considerable drawback always had to come with it.

+!]
To dom (M - a monster):
	say "[if the size of penis > 0]You use [NameDesc of M] as your own personal cocksleeve! Then [he of M] runs away, humiliated and angry.[otherwise]You finger-bang [NameDesc of M] into submission. [big he of M] runs away, humiliated and angry.[end if]".

[DOMINANT SEX FRAMEWORK]

[!<DominateUpMonster>+

This function increments the times-dominated value for M, then increments dominated-count for the player. This allows the game to keep track of how many times the player has dominated a monster, and how many monsters the player has dominated overall.

@param <Monster>:<M> The monster the player dominated

-3 - Watersports
-2 - Sex
-1 - Blowjob
0 - nothing
1 - facesitting
2 - not conventional sex
3 - Cowgirl

*!]

Player-fucker is a body part that varies.

Dominating is an action applying to one thing.

[!<CheckDominating>+

This functions determines whether we let the player try to dominate a monster, and sets things up for the actual attempt. Players that have a penis and players who are wearing strap-ons have an option to use those on monsters. Players also have an option to use either their vagina (female players) or their asshole (male players). If the player has no penis or no strap-on, then it defaults to one of those two. Once we know what the player will be using to dominate the monster, we perform some more specific checks to make sure that the player is actually able to use that properly. NOTE: if the player has a chastity item on, then they won't be able to use a penis for sex, even if it's not directly attached to their body

[!<CarryOutDominating>+

This function handles a player's attempt to dominate a given monster. Dominant sex is controlled by a value called player-fucking. This value manipulates a couple things in the Orgasm extension, but mostly we use it here. if player-fucking is DOMINANT-FAILURE, it means the player failed to dominate the monster. If it's DOMINANT-DOMINANT, if means the player succeeded. If it's DOMINANT-NONE, it means we don't know yet.

We start off with a check to see if the monster in question is over 50% hp or if the player has max delicateness, which is an automatic failure.
IF we can't determine anything with that, we use a special function called DecideWhichNumberIsTheSubmissivenessOfMonster, which outputs either 1 or -1 depending on a couple factors.
Now that we have the result, we diverge.
IF THE PLAYER SUCCEEDED, we output some flavour text describing the monster and the player having sex. In general, if the player uses their penis/strapon for sex, big penis is good, small penis is bad. If the player uses a fuckhole for sex and the monster has a penis, the player will usually ride on top of them and then have some choice at the end of the scene, depending on a couple factors. Otherwise, the player will sit on a monster's face, which probably won't get the player an orgasm, but it has few drawbacks. Once the scene has been displayed, we apply any rewards for dominant sex. These rewards vary depending on the monster and any specific events that may have happened in the scene. Once we're done, we send the monster somewhere else so the player can't immediately attack them again, although this isn't actually a big problem, since they'll instantly be at full health after it's over. It is not necessary to make the monster lose interest after a successful dominance scene, and in the case of male monsters that fuck the player, it can be inadvisable, since it makes it difficult to know whether or not the player used a condom.
IF THE PLAYER FAILED, we output a short piece of flavour where the monster turns the tables. After that, the monster will give the player some sort of unique punishment. In general, these punishments should not be something the player wants to repeat, so the player doesn't use it as an excuse to always weasel out of normal punishments. Note that if the monster has a penis, it's often strictly worse than if the player had just done things the normal way. If the monster is still interested after handling the punishment, it means they ARE going to do things the normal way, so we don't send them anywhere.
AFTER EVERYTHING is said and done, we reset player-fucking to 0.

This function calculates the "dominance score" of the player, which is derived from the player's sex addiction, delicateness, and orifice openness, in addition to penis size and the enchantment types of any pieces of worn clothing. Male players always have an inherent advantage, so we try to compensate a little bit by taking the average gape of both holes for female players. If the player learns the fuckskill, orifice openness and sex addiction are omitted from the calculation.
Selkie: what would add a lot of value to this comment is some concrete examples of dominance values to use.

If N is greater than or equal to D, the player wins with no further check. 3rd check: Retry 2nd check.

This function should usually be called when the player successfully dominates a male monster, such that it completely replaces the normal unique dominance reward. Usual reward is a substantial delicateness decrease. Since there's a possibility of the
player being inseminated during the sex, the player can choose to apply a condom to their partner before the event. If they do, there's no risk of creampie and the player will always get to cum. Skipping the condom obviously brings a risk of a creampie, so to balance it out, one pinned condom will be removed from their clothing, prioritizing torn condoms first, then full ones.

The failed dominance punishment should be implemented for any monster that the player can dominate.

If the monster won't be having sex with the player right after, the punishment here should be a bit more intense, and we should make sure the monster loses interest at the end.

The text here should output when M teleports to another room after the player unsuccessfully dominates them.

@param <Monster>:<M> The monster the player tried to dominate

To say DominanceFailed of (M - a monster):
	say "[line break][BigNameDesc of M] hurries off before you have a chance to stop [him of M].".

[!<ComputeSissification>+

computeSissification is called whenever the monster doesn't have another punishment for the player, or we weren't satisfied with the monster's normal punishment was light, so we want to make it more intense. It can summon sissy items or increase delicateness, but it could always have some other effects added later. The idea here is that failing to dominate a monster too many times will put the player into a downward spiral that they have trouble recovering from, but that can be avoided by playing smart with your odds. Most punishments from this function should be more on the side of harsh, with small upsides here and there.

To compute sissification:
	let S be a random off-stage sissifying actually summonable fetish appropriate clothing;
	if the player is male and transGender is 0 and pink sissy bow is off-stage and pink sissy bow is actually summonable:
		say "[bold type]A silky pink bow appears in your hair![line break][variable custom style][if the bimbo of the player < 5]Is this bullshit game trying to tell me I'd make more sense as a girl?[otherwise]I get it... only a girl would have trouble doing something like that...[end if][roman type][line break]";
		summon pink sissy bow cursed;
	otherwise if pink sissy bow is worn and S is clothing:
		say "[bold type]As if reacting to your lack of dominance, you suddenly feel a [ShortDesc of S] [bold type]appear on you![line break][variable custom style][one of]Uh-oh...[or]This is making me feel like a pathetic [sissy]...[or]Even more [sissy] clothing?![stopping][roman type][line break]";
		summon S cursed;
		announce sissification;
	otherwise:
		say "The [if the player is male and transGender is 0]emasculating[otherwise]humiliating[end if] memory locks itself into place, [bold type]sure to make you more submissive from now on.[roman type][line break][variable custom style][one of]I should stop pretending to be dominant...[or]It's obvious to everyone how pathetic I am...[or]How can I be dominant when I'm already so pathetic?[stopping][roman type][line break]";

To compute enslaved domination of (M - a monster):
	if the teaseTimer of M > 0:
		say "You already did that recently. Perhaps give them a bit of a break first.";
	otherwise if the player is not able to use their hands:
		say "You can't use your hands right now so there's not much you can do.";
	otherwise:
		allocate 6 seconds;
		now the teaseTimer of M is 50;
		compute default enslaved domination of M.

To compute default enslaved domination of (M - a monster):
	say EnslavedDominationFlav of M;
	if the raw delicateness of the player > the EnslavedDominationThreshold of M:
		say "You feel vaguely better about yourself, but mostly just a bit ambivalent.";
	otherwise:
		DelicateDown 1.

To say EnslavedDominationFlav of (M - a monster):
	say "You spank [NameDesc of M] on the buttcheeks, eliciting a pained yelp. ".

To decide which number is the EnslavedDominationThreshold of (M - a monster):
	decide on 10.
