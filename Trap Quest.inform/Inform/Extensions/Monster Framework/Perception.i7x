Perception by Monster Framework begins here.

Part 1 - Perception

A monster has a number called favour.  The favour of a monster is usually 13.  [The favour of an NPC determines when it turns unfriendly.]

perceiving is a number that varies. [We want to suppress some text while we are in the middle of perception.]
 
To FavourReset (M - a monster):
	now the favour of M is the default favour of M.

To decide which number is the default favour of (M - a monster):
	decide on 13.

Chapter 1 - Check Perception

To check perception of (M - a monster):
	if M is aware:
		if M is interested:
			if M is uniquely unfriendly:
				if the babification of M is 1 and the previous-babification of M is 0:
					compute sudden babification of M; [The NPC is now unfriendly, because the player's appearance has changed.  We need to make this obvious to the player by making them say something.]
					now the previous-babification of M is 1;
				otherwise if the objectification of M is 1 and the previous-objectification of M is 0:
					compute sudden objectification of M; [The NPC is now unfriendly, because the player's appearance has changed.  We need to make this obvious to the player by making them say something.]
					now the previous-objectification of M is 1;
		otherwise:
			now M is interested;
			now the last-tripped of M is 0;
			now the last-interaction of M is 0;
			if M is the father:
				calm M;
				say "The [M] notices you![line break]The [M] seems to be waiting for something..."; [Waiting for you to give birth to their baby]
			otherwise if the scared of M > 0:
				say "[if the class of the player is cheerleader]The [M] notices you and awkwardly starts to move in the other direction.[otherwise if the blue-balls of M > 0 and M is demoness]The [M] scoffs and starts to move in the other direction.[otherwise]The [M] notices you immediately and starts to run away![end if]";
			otherwise if the class of the player is vixen and there is a worn kimono and a random number between 1 and 4 > 1:
				do nothing;
			otherwise:
				compute correct perception of M;
			increase the times-met of M by 1;
			if M is unfriendly:
				now the previous-babification of M is 1;
				now the previous-objectification of M is 1;
			otherwise:
				now the previous-babification of M is the babification of M;
				now the previous-objectification of M is the objectification of M;
			if M is interested:
				[if the class of the player is cheerleader and a random number between 1 and 5 is 1:
					say "Your [printed name of a random worn pink scrunchie] feels warm, and you suddenly have the urge to open your mouth and say whatever comes to mind.";
					try greeting M; Caused some weird interactions with shocked monsters]
				if newbie tips is 1:
					if M is friendly, say "[one of][item style]Newbie tip: You have been noticed by an NPC!  Looks like this one is friendly, which means you could try using 'greet' and 'question' verbs to find out more from them.  If thirsty, you could even 'ask [M] [item style]for drink'.[roman type][line break][or][stopping]";
					otherwise say "[one of][item style]Newbie tip: You have been noticed by an NPC!  Looks like this one is unfriendly, which usually always means [he of M] wants to [if diaper quest is 1]babify[otherwise]fuck[end if] you, or at the very least make your life more miserable in some way.  You can either fight back with 'slap', 'knee' or 'kick' (you'll need to be standing), or you can run away!  If your delicateness is high enough, there's also a third option, just get on your knees and let it happen... Anyway, if you want to fight back, experiment with the different attacks.  At the start of the game, kicking is usually the worst option as you risk falling over and do less damage.[roman type][line break][or][stopping]";
				reset orifice selection of M. [Otherwise they would be biased towards doing the same thing again, which is lame.]

To compute correct perception of (M - a monster):
	if diaper quest is 1, compute DQ perception of M;
	otherwise compute perception of M.

To reset orifice selection of (M - a monster):
	now the chosen-orifice of M is nothing;
	now the selection-frustration of M is 0.

To compute DQ perception of (M - a monster):
	compute perception of M.

Chapter 2 - Aggro Framework

Definition: a monster (called M) is aware:
	if the sleep of M > 0 or the boredom of M > 0, decide no;
	if the player is too high to see, decide no;
	if M is in the location of the player, decide yes;
	if M is nearby and magnetism-elixir-timer > 0, decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide which number is the aggro limit of (M - a monster): [The number at which they turn unfriendly]
	decide on 10.

To DifficultyUp (M - a monster) by (X - a number):
	while X > 0:
		increase the difficulty of M by 1;
		decrease X by 1.
	[if debugmode > 0, say "Now the difficulty of [M] is [the difficulty of M]".]

[This is coded as a loop, MG explained, in case something happens when a monster passes a certain threshold of difficulty(and only when passing that threshold of difficulty)]
To DifficultyDown (M - a monster) by (X - a number):
	while X > 0:
		decrease the difficulty of M by 1;
		decrease X by 1.

[
Aggro Ratings:
BELOW AGGRO LIMIT: Unfriendly
AGGRO LIMIT: Annoyed
AGGRO LIMIT + 2: Acquaintance
AGGRO LIMIT + 4: Buddy
AGGRO LIMIT + 7: Ally
AGGRO LIMIT + 10: Guardian
]

Definition: a monster (called M) is unfriendly:
	if the favour of M <= the aggro limit of M or M is uniquely unfriendly, decide yes;
	decide no.
	
Definition: a monster (called M) is friendly:
	if M is unfriendly, decide no;
	decide yes.

[Selkie: it might be easier to remember, if this was termed temporarily unfriendly?]
Definition: a monster (called M) is uniquely unfriendly: [We can use this to easily specify when a monster is pissed off regardless of usual stats.]
	if M is objectifying the player, decide yes;
	if M is babifying the player, decide yes;
	decide no.

A monster has a number called objectification. [If an NPC is objectifying the player, and that's the only reason they're unfriendly, we want to make this unfriendliness stick for the duration of their interaction.  Otherwise, the NPC could start to have sex with the player but then the player's make up fades causing the NPC to suddenly become friendly mid-fuck.]
A monster has a number called previous-objectification.  [Similarly, if the NPC is friendly and the player suddenly looks more slutty, we don't want the NPC to become unfriendly without saying something.  Tracking whether the NPC was objectifying last turn will help us know when we need to make the NPC say something as they switch to hostile.]

A monster has a number called babification. [Diaper quest version of objectification.]
A monster has a number called previous-babification.

To compute sudden objectification of (M - a monster):
	if M is intelligent:
		if M is raunchy, say "Something seems to change in the way the [M] is looking at you.  [speech style of M]'[if M is penetrating a body part]Yeah [slut], take it!'[otherwise if the player is monster fucked]You're going to just do that without asking me to join in?!'[otherwise]We should fuck.'[end if][roman type][line break]";
		otherwise say "Something seems to change in the way the [M] is looking at you.  [speech style of M]'Hmm, I've changed my mind...'[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "The [M] suddenly turns hostile!".

Definition: a monster (called M) is objectifying the player:
	if diaper quest is 1, decide no;
	if M is not interested:
		now the objectification of M is 0;
		decide no;
	if the objectification of M is 1, decide yes;
	if the class of the player is cheerleader, decide no;
	if the bimbo of the player >= 20 or the appearance of the player >= 20 or the appearance of the player > the bimbo tolerance of M:
		now the objectification of M is 1;
		decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide which number is the bimbo tolerance of (M - a monster):
	if M is wenchy and there is a worn demon codpiece, decide on 1;
	decide on 16.
	
	

To compute sudden babification of (M - a monster):
	if M is intelligent:
		say "Something seems to change in the way the [M] is looking at you.  [speech style of M]'Aww, you really do look just like a little baby now... I think it's time for me to treat you like one, don't you?'[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "The [M] suddenly turns hostile!".

Definition: a monster (called M) is babifying the player:
	if diaper quest is 0, decide no;
	if M is not interested:
		now the babification of M is 0;

	if the class of the player is adult baby, decide yes; [not sure about this]
	if the bimbo of the player >= 20 or the cringe appearance of the player >= 20 or the cringe appearance of the player > the cringe tolerance of M:
		now the babification of M is 1;
		decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide which number is the cringe tolerance of (M - a monster):
	decide on 16.

	say "[big he of M] ";
	if M is intelligent, say "looks you up and down.";
	otherwise say "pauses, taking notice of you.".


Chapter 3 - Modifying Aggro

To anger (M - a monster): [This should bring the monster just into unfriendly territory.]
	if the diaper-duration of M > 0, now the diaper-duration of M is the diaper punishment length of M;
	if the favour of M > the aggro limit of M:
		now the favour of M is the aggro limit of M.

To calm (M - a monster): [This should bring the monster just into friendly territory.]
