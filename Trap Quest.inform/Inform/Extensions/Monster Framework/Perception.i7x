Perception by Monster Framework begins here.

Part 1 - Perception

A monster has a number called favour. The favour of a monster is 15. [The favour of an NPC determines when it turns unfriendly.]
A monster has a number called latest-appearance. [The last time the NPC saw the player, what did they look like? We only update this when the player looked worse than before, or the NPC gets bored then rediscovers the player. So flashing an NPC 5 times in quick succession is not any worse than flashing them once.]
A monster has a number called latest-cringe. [The last time the NPC saw the player, how childish did they look?]

perceiving is a number that varies. [We want to suppress some text while we are in the middle of perception.]

To FavourReset (M - a monster):
	FavourSet M to the default favour of M.

To decide which number is the default favour of (M - a monster):
	decide on 16 - game difficulty.

[Sometimes we want to skip perception entirely and get straight to the good stuff]
To compute sudden interested appearance of (M - a monster):
	if M is not in the location of the player:
		say "[BigNameDesc of M] appears in front of you!";
		now M is in the location of the player;
		if M is uninterested:
			interest M;
			compute just-became-interested of M;
	if M is uninterested:
		say "[BigNameDesc of M][']s eyes perk up!";
		interest M;
		compute just-became-interested of M.

To compute just-became-interested of (M - a monster):
	if latest-top-malfunction is not 0 and M is intelligent and M is friendly, now latest-top-malfunction is earnings; [If an intelligent NPC has noticed the player for whatever reason that probably means they would have seen a nip slip if one existed. So we'll say one didn't exist.]
	progress quest of whore-exposing-quest for M;
	if M is intelligent:
		progress quest of show-and-tell-quest for M;
		if topless temporary fetish > 0 and breasts is lewdly exposed:
			decrease topless temporary fetish by 1;
			if topless temporary fetish is 0, say "[bold type]Your brain finally seems satisfied that you've exposed your breasts to enough people. You will no longer lose intelligence from concealing your nipples.[roman type][line break]";
			otherwise say "You [one of]can tell you have made progress towards removing the curse that makes you desperate to keep your breasts exposed[or]have made more progress towards removing your topless fetish curse[cycling].";
	if the times-met of M < 0, now the times-met of M is 0;
	increase the times-met of M by 1;
	if M is friendly human monster and breasts is exposed:
		progress quest of chest-exposing-quest from M.

Chapter 1 - Check Perception

hypno-curtsey-trigger is a number that varies.
whore-exposing-quest is a headgear-clothing-quest.
stealthActive is initially true.

To decide which number is the stealth of the player:
	let P be 2;
	decrease P by the hindrance of the player;
	repeat with C running through currently visible wearthing:
		increase P by the stealth-influence of C;
	if water-fountain is penetrating asshole, increase P by 6;
	if the player is prone, increase P by 2;
	if skirt-tray-vibrator is worn, decrease P by 1;
	decide on P.

	now stealthActive is false;
	check perception of M;
	now stealthActive is true.

To check perception of (M - a monster):
	if M is aware:

		otherwise if M is defeated:

You can either fight back with 'slap', 'knee' or 'kick' (you'll need to be standing), or you can run away! If your delicateness is high enough, there's also a third option, just get on your knees and let it happen... Anyway, if you want to fight back, experiment with the different attacks. At the start of the game, kicking is usually the worst option as you risk falling over and do less damage.[roman type][line break][or][stopping]";
						if the class of the player is chosen one and M is intelligent and M is threatening and M is combative:

Chapter 2 - Aggro Framework

Definition: a monster (called M) is aware: [Can it notice the player on its own?]
	if M is woman-player and M is stranger, decide no;
	if M is asleep or the boredom of M > 0, decide no;
	if M is in the location of the player, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a person is reactive:
	if it is in the location of the player, decide yes;
	decide no. [Can it react to things it sees the player do?]
Definition: yourself is reactive: decide no.
Definition: a monster is reactive:
	if it is uniquely unreactive, decide no;
	if it is uniquely reactive, decide yes;
	if it is awake and it is intelligent and it is undefeated and the player is not in a predicament room and it is in the location of the player and (it is interested or the player is not stealthy), decide yes;
	decide no. [Can it react to things it sees the player do?]

Definition: a monster is uniquely reactive: decide no.
Definition: a monster is uniquely unreactive: decide no.

To decide which number is the aggro limit of (M - a monster): [The number at which they turn unfriendly]
	decide on 10.

To DifficultyUp (M - a monster) by (X - a number):
	let D be the raw difficulty of M;
	SilentlyDifficultyUp M by X;
	let DD be the raw difficulty of M - D;
	if DD > 0 and M is in the location of the player, say "[BigNameDesc of M] looks [if DD > 1]much [otherwise]somewhat[one of]... [or] [stopping][end if]stronger.";

To SilentlyDifficultyUp (M - a monster) by (X - a number):
	let MH be false;
	if the health of M >= the maxhealth of M, now MH is true;
	while X > 0:
		increase the raw difficulty of M by 1;
		decrease X by 1;
	if MH is true, now the health of M is the maxhealth of M;
	if debugmode > 0, say "[input-style]the raw difficulty of [FuckerDesc of M] is now [raw difficulty of M].[roman type][line break]".

[This is coded as a loop, MG explained, in case something happens when a monster passes a certain threshold of difficulty(and only when passing that threshold of difficulty)]
[Aika: That's not true, currently this loop is pointless. There's no way the code can detect when a threshold is reached. It does however mean that it follows the same structure as other similar functions and could be quickly modified in the future to allow for such triggers.]
To DifficultyDown (M - a monster) by (X - a number):
	while X > 0:
		decrease the raw difficulty of M by 1;
		decrease X by 1.

[We use this to save the state of whether the enemy is unfriendly when possible, to reduce CPU cycles.
recently-unknown means that the monster's friendliness rating has 'expired', meaning that we need to check again.
]
A monster can be recently-unknown, recently-unfriendly, or recently-friendly (this is the monster-friendliness property).

Definition: a monster (called M) is unfriendly rather than friendly:
	if M is recently-unfriendly, decide yes;
	if M is recently-friendly, decide no;
	if M is calculated unfriendly:
		if debugmode > 1 and M is not recently-unfriendly, say "Setting [M] from [if M is recently-friendly]friendly[otherwise]unknown[end if] to unfriendly.";
		now M is recently-unfriendly;
		decide yes; ["annoyed" is the final level of relationship before unfriendly]
	otherwise:
		if debugmode > 1 and M is not recently-friendly, say "Setting [M] from [if M is recently-unfriendly]unfriendly[otherwise]unknown[end if] to friendly.";
		now M is recently-friendly;
		decide no.

Definition: a monster (called M) is calculated unfriendly:
	if M is not pacified and (M is not normally annoyed or M is uniquely unfriendly), decide yes;
	decide no.

[Selkie: it might be easier to remember, if this was termed temporarily unfriendly?]
Definition: a monster (called M) is uniquely unfriendly: [We can use this to easily specify when a monster is pissed off regardless of usual stats.]
	if M is default uniquely unfriendly, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a monster (called M) is default uniquely unfriendly:
	if M is friendly-fucking, decide no;
	if M is in the location of the player:
		if M is objectifying the player, decide yes;
		if M is babifying the player, decide yes;
		if M is able to see stolen goods, decide yes;
	if there is a soiled-diaper carried by M, decide yes;
	decide no.

A monster has a number called objectification. [If an NPC is objectifying the player, and that's the only reason they're unfriendly, we want to make this unfriendliness stick for the duration of their interaction. Otherwise, the NPC could start to have sex with the player but then the player's make up fades causing the NPC to suddenly become friendly mid-fuck.]
A monster has a number called previous-objectification. [Similarly, if the NPC is friendly and the player suddenly looks more slutty, we don't want the NPC to become unfriendly without saying something. Tracking whether the NPC was objectifying last turn will help us know when we need to make the NPC say something as they switch to hostile.]

A monster has a number called babification. [Diaper quest version of objectification.]
A monster has a number called previous-babification.

To compute sudden objectification of (M - a monster):
	now M is recently-unfriendly;
	if M is intelligent:
		if M is raunchy, say "Something seems to change in the way [NameDesc of M] is looking at you.[line break][speech style of M]'[if M is penetrating a body part or M is grabbing the player]Yeah [slut], take it!'[otherwise if the player is monster fucked]You're going to just do that without asking me to join in?!'[otherwise]We should fuck.'[end if][roman type][line break]";
		otherwise say "Something seems to change in the way [NameDesc of M] is looking at you.[line break][speech style of M]'Hmm, I've changed my mind...'[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of][BigNameDesc of M] suddenly turns hostile[or]Something changes in the way [NameDesc of M] is looking at you, and you get the feeling [he of M]'s become hostile[at random]!".

Definition: a monster (called M) is objectifying the player:

Chapter 3 - Modifying Aggro

To anger (M - a monster): [This should bring the monster just into unfriendly territory.]
	if the diaper-duration of M > 0, now the diaper-duration of M is the diaper punishment length of M;
	if M is recently-friendly, now M is recently-unknown; [reset what we know about the friendliness of the NPC]
	if the favour of M > the aggro limit of M:
		now M is recently-unknown;
		FavourSet M to the aggro limit of M.

To calm (M - a monster): [This should bring the monster just into friendly territory.]
	if M is recently-unfriendly, now M is recently-unknown; [reset what we know about the friendliness of the NPC]
	if the favour of M <= the aggro limit of M:
		now M is recently-unknown;
		FavourSet M to the aggro limit of M + 1.

To permanently anger (M - a monster): [This should bring the monster far far into unfriendly territory.]
	now M is recently-unknown; [reset what we know about the friendliness of the NPC]
	FavourSet M to -100.

To FavourUp (M - a monster):
	FavourUp M by 1.

To FavourDown (M - a monster):
	FavourDown M by 1.

To FavourDown (M - a monster) with consequences:
	FavourDown M by 1 with consequences.

To FavourUp (M - a monster) by (N - a number):
	if the class of the player is cheerleader, increase N by 1;
	if N > 0:
		now M is recently-unknown; [reset what we know about the friendliness of the NPC]
		increase the favour of M by N;
		if M is witch and M is normally annoyed and M is alive:
			now M is in Woods20;
			now M is guarding;
		if M is royal guard and the refractory-period of M < 0:
			progress quest of royal-quest;
			now the refractory-period of M is the refractory-time of M. [This stops the player being able to trigger the duty performed repeatedly within a short time]

To FavourDown (M - a monster) by (N - a number) with consequences:
	if M is alive:
		FavourDown M by N;
		check aggression change of M;

To FavourDown (M - a monster) by (N - a number):
	if latest-top-malfunction is not 0 and M is reactive, now latest-top-malfunction is earnings; [If an intelligent interested NPC has lost favour with the player for whatever reason that probably means they would have seen a nip slip if one existed. So we'll say one didn't exist.]
	if the class of the player is cheerleader and a random number between 1 and 2 is 1, decrease N by 1;
	if N > 0:
		now M is recently-unknown; [reset what we know about the friendliness of the NPC]

Part 2 - Reflection

shocked-monsters is a number that varies. [The number of monsters that have noticed the player right now, if the player is humiliated]

aroused-monsters is a number that varies. [The number of monsters that have noticed the player right now, if the player is aroused]

Definition: a number (called N) is too humiliating:
	if background-exhibitionist is 1, decide no;
	if N * 2000 > the humiliation of the player + 6000, decide yes;
	decide no.

[!<PersonIsOutraged>+

Is the player wearing something too embarrassing for their tolerance level?

+!]
Definition: a person is outraged:
	if background-exhibitionist is 1, decide no;
	if calculated-appearance-outrage-level is too humiliating, decide yes;
	if diaper quest is 1 and calculated-cringe-level is too humiliating, decide yes;
	decide no.

[!<PersonIsNearlyOutraged>+

Is the player wearing something almost too embarrassing for their tolerance level? (This will arouse exhibitionist players)

+!]
Definition: a person is nearly outraged:
	if the humiliation of the player < 20000, decide no;
	if calculated-appearance-outrage-level + 5 is too humiliating, decide yes;
	if diaper quest is 1 and calculated-cringe-level + 5 is too humiliating, decide yes;
	decide no.

To say mortifiedOutfit on (C - a thing):
	say ", which makes you very self-conscious about your [MediumDesc of C], and [one of]sends shivers of mortifying humiliation down your spine[or]feel even more nervous about who might be watching you in this awkward situation[or]feel so uneasy that blood rushes to your head[if the player is upright] and you almost lose your balance[otherwise] and you shudder uncontrollably[end if][or]consumes you with an overwhelming sense of shame[or]find yourself in disbelief that you've allowed yourself to be demeaned like this[or]for a moment feel so bashful and vulnerable that you lose your composure[or]for a moment feel so incredibly shy that you almost want to just hide in a dark corner until the time runs out[or]causes you to cringe with humiliation[in random order]".

[!<PersonIsSluttilyDressed>+

We use this at the appropriate point during a 'say' command during the perception computation of an intelligent monster to trigger the humiliation and the extra text

+!]
Definition: a person is sluttily dressed:
	increase shocked-monsters by 1;
	let AL be calculated-appearance-outrage-level;
	let AT be appearance-outrage-target;
	if diaper quest is 1 and calculated-cringe-level >= AL:
		now AL is calculated-cringe-level;
		now AT is appearance-cringe-target;
	if shocked-monsters > 1:
		say " at the same time, [one of]worsening the situation[or]making the humiliation even worse[or]making you feel even more self-conscious[or]turning you an even brighter shade of red[purely at random]";
		humiliate (10 * AL) / shocked-monsters; [Each extra monster adds less than the one before]
		decide yes;
	otherwise if 17 is too humiliating and the player is outraged: [We consider the player no longer embarrassed about appearance after outrage 16]
		if AL - 4 is too humiliating:
			say "[one of][mortifiedOutfit on AT][or] and [if AT is asshole]catches a glimpse of[otherwise if AT is body part]can see[otherwise]can easily see[end if] your [MediumDesc of AT], making you [blush 10 * AL][purely at random]";

			humiliate 10 * AL;
		decide yes;
	decrease shocked-monsters by 1; [if we're deciding no, then we remove the shocked monster count]
	increase aroused-monsters by 1;
	if aroused-monsters > 1:
		say " at the same time, [one of]making you even more aroused[or]turning you on even more[or]turning you an even brighter shade of red[at random]";
		arouse 100;
		decide yes;
	otherwise if the player is nearly outraged: [The player no longer feels embarrassed about clothing, only aroused at being seen! But if their clothing is too boring, they won't even be aroused.]
		say ", and you find yourself feeling [one of]thrillingly nervous[or]getting a little [if the player is a bit horny]more [end if]turned on[or]blushing with shyness and pride[or]shivering with nervous excitement[at random] because [he of current-monster] can see your [if the number of worn rings > 1 and AT is ring][number of worn rings] rings[otherwise][MediumDesc of AT][end if]";
		arouse 25 * AL;
		decide yes;
	decrease aroused-monsters by 1;
	decide no.

Perception ends here.
