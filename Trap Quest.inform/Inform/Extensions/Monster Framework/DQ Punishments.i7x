DQ Punishments by Monster Framework begins here.


This is the choosing a diaper punishment rule:
	choose a diaper punishment;
	if chosen diaper punishment is punishment-not-found:
		if debugmode > 0, say "No acceptable diaper punishment found.";
	otherwise:
		if debugmode > 0, say "Selected [chosen diaper punishment].";
		compute punishment of chosen diaper punishment;
		rule succeeds.
The choosing a diaper punishment rule is listed first in the default diaper quest rules.

A diaper punishment is a kind of object. A diaper punishment has a number called priority.

To choose a diaper punishment:
	now chosen diaper punishment is punishment-not-found;
	now current-priority is 6;
	while chosen diaper punishment is punishment-not-found and current-priority >= 0:
		now chosen diaper punishment is a random prioritised appropriate diaper punishment;
		unless chosen diaper punishment is a diaper punishment, now chosen diaper punishment is punishment-not-found;
		decrease current-priority by 1.
