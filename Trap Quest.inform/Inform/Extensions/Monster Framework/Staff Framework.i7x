To set up (M - a staff member):
	reset M;
	now the monstersetup of M is 1;

To uniquely set up (M - a staff member):
	do nothing.

To regionally place (M - a staff member):
	while M is not in the school or M is in the location of the player or M is nearby:
		now M is in a random schoolplaced room.

Definition: a staff member is human: decide yes.

Definition: a staff member is uniquely unfriendly: decide no.

staff-combat-warning is initially false.

Check slapping a staff member:
	unless the player is purposefully rebelling, say "Action cancelled." instead.
Check kneeing a staff member:
	unless the player is purposefully rebelling, say "Action cancelled." instead.
Check kicking a staff member:
	unless the player is purposefully rebelling, say "Action cancelled." instead.

Definition: yourself is purposefully rebelling:

Part - Lessons

A lesson is a kind of object. A lesson has a teacher called lesson-teacher.

class-time is a number that varies. class-time is 1000.

chosen-lesson is an object that varies.

lesson-room is a room that varies.

[Lesson "style guide," lifted from discord

Firstly all classes should have a way to promote both the player and the students. Doesn't need to happen every time but it would be good to have it happen a lot of the time. Secondly I prefer it when classes give some kind of the decision to the player, even if it's just whether to participate in the 'test' at the end or not. But this isn't mandatory.

Sapphire classes should be something that is at least vaguely feasible as being interpreted in how to act like a proper lady.

Emerald classes can be lewd but not involve sex. The focus begins to shift over to being attractive and submissive to dominants, or men. Body modification will be very present here. Maybe one or more lessons to do with latex.

Ruby classes will begin to include sexual acts, including vanilla with real penises. Practising oral on dildos, drinking cum but not from the tap, that sort of thing, and then also there will be a male teacher who does 'practical' sessions.

Pink Diamond classes will take sex to the next level - sex is just the foreplay and the real competition is how you can degrade yourself further during or after sex. For example, snowballing / felching cum from others, wearing used condoms, etc. I imagine that watersports and similar degrading acts go here too. Anal sex probably goes here. Fucking two guys at the same time.

Pure diamond classes (the final level) - I imagine there won't be many of these at all. One would just be some unholy mix of the above, a gangbang (or orgy) with all the worst stuff - felching anal creampies, lots of watersports if enabled, bondage, attempted mass insemination, maybe it's blindfolded, etc.
And the other pure diamond class would be fucking an inhuman beast, or tentacle monster, if enabled.

###Selkie wonders about the possibility of a less extreme option, in which the extreme angle is something like a gangbang that's also viewed via cam of the player's friends and family members? Or streamed live to social media in the real world?

This is the class-time cooldown rule:
	if class-time < 1000 and armband is not solid gold and (playerRegion is not Hotel or Hotel40 is discovered) and (playerRegion is not Mansion or Mansion32 is discovered): [We use 1000 to represent that the player hasn't been to a class before.] [Players who are in the hotel looking for the warp portal shouldn't be penalised]
		let CS be counters-seconds;
		if class-time <= 0 and playerRegion is Woods, now CS is (CS + 1) / 2; [Woods is further away from the school so school time moves slower here.]
		if playerRegion is not School or class-time <= 0, decrease class-time by CS;
		if class-time <= 0 and class-time + CS > 0 and armband is worn:
			say "[bold type]Your [ShortDesc of armband] begins to beep like an alarm clock! ";
			[if (playerRegion is Dungeon or playerRegion is Woods or playerRegion is Hotel or playerRegion is Mansion) and the number of warp portals in the location of the player is 0:
				now school portal is in the location of the player;
				say "A shimmering green [school portal] appears [if north is N-viable]to the north, blocking that exit[otherwise if playerRegion is Woods]in front of the trees to the north[otherwise]on the north wall[end if].";]
			say "[line break][variable custom style][one of]Huh?! Does this mean it's time for the next class or something?[or]Time for class again...[stopping][roman type][line break]".
The class-time cooldown rule is listed in the advance counters rules.

	if the lesson-teacher of L is alive and the lesson-teacher of L is undefeated and L is lesson-appropriate, decide yes;
	decide no.

Report going north:
	now lesson-room is the location of the player;
	compute potential lesson.

To decide which number is lessonFrequency:
	decide on 150.

totalLessonCount is a number that varies.

To compute potential lesson:
	if lesson-room is a lecture academic room and armband is worn and armband is not solid gold and the armband-print of armband is not "new recruit":
		if debugmode > 0, say "Class time tracker is at [class-time]; less than [lessonFrequency * -3] = detention.";
		if class-time is 1000 or class-time <= 0:
			now chosen-lesson is a random correctly-ranked appropriate lesson;
			if chosen-lesson is not lesson:
				say "ERROR: No lesson currently coded for this class for the player's current state. If this is an early alpha of the school, it's likely that this content just doesn't exist yet! Come back soon. For now, we'll change the timer so that the game thinks you've had a lesson.";
				now class-time is lessonFrequency;
			otherwise if class-time < (lessonFrequency * -3):
				compute detention of lesson-teacher of chosen-lesson;
				now class-time is lessonFrequency;
			otherwise:
				if chosen-lesson is correctly-situated:

					increase totalLessonCount by 1;
					let B be (the rank of the player * 3) - the bimbo of the player;
					repeat with C running through worn clothing:
						if the quest of C is next-lesson-quest, increase B by 2;
					if B > 0, increase class-time by B * 60; [Lessons are spaced further apart if the player isn't slutty enough for them]
				otherwise:
					say "Your rank is [accessory-colour of armband], so there's no lesson for you here.".

To compute teaching of (L - an object):
	say "BUG - Tried to compute teaching of [L], but it doesn't exist.".

To set up (L - a lesson):
	repeat with M running through monsters in lesson-room:

	while the number of students in lesson-room > 5:
		let ST be a random student in lesson-room;
		regionally place ST;
		if ST is not in lesson-room, now the boredom of ST is 0.

		if the player is in School16 and the player is not in danger:
			execute A;
			decrease the assemblyTime of A by 1;
			if the assemblyTime of A <= 0, conclude A;

More detention ideas:

Hole
-Player has to work a gloryhole for high level students. (timer)

Tutoring
-Player is paired up with a student of higher or equal rank(or lower rank if absolutely necessary)
-Sex here, maybe?

Conference(maybe this would be better as a thing that happens naturally)
-The player is taken to the headmistress, who contacts someone the player knows (ex, room-mate 1, room-mate 2, room-mate 1 and 2)
-The person comments on the player's appearance somehow, and (maybe) has the chance to mess with the player remotely
