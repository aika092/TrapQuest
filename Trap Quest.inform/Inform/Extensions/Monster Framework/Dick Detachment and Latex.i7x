 players-detached-dick --
     the object used and carried around when the player has had the detachable penis fate. It can be taken by monsters and carried around.
     The size of the detached dick is tracked with a value separate from the one usually used, and is a property of it being a sex toy (since that has a size).
     The size of the scrotum (which detaches with the penis) is tracked by a separate value called ballsize.
     These sizes are initialised when the penis is detached.
     We set player's penis (and ball) size (of their body) to zero and block PenisUp (and ScrotumUp), or otherwise most points in the code that check the player's penis size need new qualifiers to check if actually the player's dick isn't in a normal state.
     We also use the IsPlastic value to flag if the penis has been detached from the player AFTER they became a latex doll (so in that case it's set to 1), or else it's set to 0 (meaning it's still living flesh).
     sex toy allows it to be inserted and used against the player, heh.
     I think it would be VERY BAD to summon players-detached-dick vaginally, as that destroys it and then summons it, so I suspect we'd lose its size values.
 detach-likelihood --
     a number between 0 and 10, 10 meaning a dick-detacher monster has for some reason decided to do its special trick.
 players-dick-is-detached --
     flags whether the player's dick is detached.
     If it's still attached, this value is 0.
     If it was removed to leave the player with a doll-like mound, it's 1.
     If it was removed to make a double-ended dildo and give the player a vagina at the same time as part of the process, its value is 2.

 max-wench-detachers is the total number of wenches the game can ever create in a single game, who possess a dick-detaching portal ring. There's a 1 in 20 chance that a wench created can have it. Obviously those numbers are adjustable.
 Some inspiration for this comes from Sei So Tsui Dan Sha by Shiwasu No Okina

 NB: if an item is held by the player, it means it is either carried by the player OR worn by the player. You can say "if item is held" and it implies "by the player", too.

A monster can be a-dick-detacher or a-non-detacher. A monster is usually a-non-detacher. [These (rare few) monsters can detach the player's dick. At present: djinn, aeromancer. And one wench, who gets a portal-cock-ring.]
A monster can be detached-dick-desiring or detached-dick-ignoring. A monster is usually detached-dick-desiring. [Most monsters are willing to take a player's detached dick if they see it lying around. Several though are not. At present: ghosts, giant wasps.]

[If the player masturbates with their own detached dick it'll mean they're either giving it a BJ or inserting it in an orifice. This should really double the pleasure, but given that masturbation-bonus normally 1 and can be as high as 5, before any magic modifiers, 2 feels about right.

[ compute detach-players-dick by (M - a thing) using (method - a number)

 This is called at the climax of some other blowjob or magic or trap
 that's triggered, preferably just before the 'happy ending' so we get
 the normal experience until just before the player's dick is
 magically detached!
 If you want a warning before it happens, then say so just before calling this,
 e.g.
     say "You feel your [semen] about to burst free!";
     compute detach-players-dick by aeromancer using 1;
     Or maybe it's better to allow it to be used mid-sentence or not.
     so this always starts with something like "when suddenly..."

 If you set method to 1 (blowjob), you should first ensure there's no clothing
 in the way.

 method indicates the kind of verb to use for the detachment:
 1: blowjob (either by a trap or a foe)
 2: tugging or pulling
 3: by pure magic variant of 2
 4...?:
    If we extend this in the future with some new method (4+), it will
    probably be something closer to tugging it off than BJ-portal magic,
    so if we add a method and forget to add code for it, this is coded up
    as 'if method is 1, otherwise...'
    (so if we add new a method: 'if method is 1, otherwise if 2, otherwise...')
    so it won't lead to as jarring an error.

So this function -- Check taking penis -- is a little bit odd and required
some discussion among the developers (i.e.: schooling Selkie).
The penis object is implemented as a background scenery object, so it's
everywhere the player can be. It's NOT the same object as the player's
detached penis.
If the player somehow knows a monster has their (detached) penis, I wanted the
player to get a believable reaction if they could somehow try to take it back.
However, if an object is carried by another person there's no way for the
player to reference it.
So while this won't let them take the penis if it's held by a monster, it's
a way to have a sensible reaction from a monster if they're carrying it.
Since it seems natural a player might type "take penis" if they think their
detached dick is available for the taking, then this can also redirect the
game from the nonsensical action of taking the true penis and instead interpret
that as meaning taking the detached dick when that makes sense.

[Wearability rules. Aika wrote:
Essentially, for each thing that would make the item not wearable, there should be a unique rule declared in this format.
summoning will be 0 if the player is putting on the item themselves and 1 if it is being put on by an NPC or being summoned by a magical effect.
if summoning is 0, autowear will be false if the player is manually putting on the item and true if the game is making the player automatically put on the item regardless of user input.
rule fails is what needs to be called if the item cannot be worn. This will end the entire rulebook, so any text you want to output when the player is manually putting the item on (i.e. when summoning is 0 and autowear is false) needs to go before this line.
Something that blocked manual wearing but not summoning would put the summoning is 0 check a line earlier, so for example:

if the player is proud and summoning is 0:
	if autowear is false, say "You're feeling too self-conscious to put that on!";
	rule fails.
because if summoning is 1, we don't want to trigger the "rule fails" line.

(Call TF level TF. There's a "TF in 8" chance, provided TF >= N.)
You can set a minimum though, N: if they're not at least that TF-ed, bored.
So if they're not TF-ed at all, the aeromancer will never be intrigued.
]
To decide if (M - an aeromancer) is latex-intrigued at least (N - a number):
	if the latex-transformation of the player < N, decide no;
	if the latex-transformation of the player >= a random number between 1 and 8, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a thing (called T) is somewhere-here:
	if T is in the location of the player, decide yes;
	if player is wearing T or player is carrying T, decide yes;
	let M be a random monster carrying T;
	if M is not nothing and M is in the location of the player, decide yes;
	decide no.

1 means shrink, 2 means grow.
M is the monster doing it, or nothing if we don't want any flavour text spoken for the exceptional cases (the reversal of M's normal preference).
When M decides to buck the natural probabilities, make some comment then.
Rather than 50/50 up or down, which just makes the aeromancer's actions feel kind of insane and unbelievable, I think it makes much more sense for her to tend to shrink the dick if it's small and grow it if it's big, knowing they can burst at one end or vanish at the other. But it would be nicely teasing to make it 50/50 for the final step at either end of the scale.
So I'm thinking 1/2 whether shrink or grow at size 1 and at max size.
But also 1/2 at sizes 6,7 - decision could go either way.
I know the numbers are equally likely to default to up or down for the input N that came from an RNG, so since N = 1 or 2 are equally likely on the scale, that can cover the selection up/down when I want a 1/2 chance.
Although this is only used for players-detached-dick here, let's pass in the penis size so it could be used if desired for normal penis grow/shrink decisions too.

Experiments are grouped into tiers of seriousness:
- tier 8 (top):
	detach dick (currently, the aeromancer will only do this if you're partly TFed already)
	inflate-burst detached dick (only possible if mostly TF-ed and TG fetish on)
- tier 6: abuse detached dick
	steal detached dick
	inflate detached dick (limited by max, unless TG is enabled)
	plug with detached dick
	inflate an already-plugging detached dick
	ruin with plugged detached dick
- tier 4: latex play
	inflate labia, if possessing a vagina
	summon a cursed bra of breast augmentation
	continue a latex transformation
	less likely, start a latex transformation
- tier 2: inflation (just the normal science experiments)
- tier 0: They don't want to mess with the player.
They're even-numbered in case one day we want to insert some in-between tiers.
]
To decide which number is desired science tier of (M - an aeromancer):
	[Might they detach the dick?]
	if M is a-dick-detacher and player is male and players-dick-is-detached is 0:
		[This ensures a detaching aeromancer will only detach latexing males; that the likelihood increases the more latex TF-ed they are; and the TF must be >= 4]
		if M is latex-intrigued at least 4:
			decide on 8;
	if M is friendly:
		decide on 0;
	if players-dick-is-detached > 0 and players-detached-dick is somewhere-here:
		[Might they try inflating a detached dick to bursting, causing TG?]
		if M is latex-intrigued at least 5 and TG fetish > 0 and the size of players-detached-dick >= 10:
			decide on 8;
		[They'll play with a detached dick 3 in 4 times if it's here.]
		if a random number between 1 and 4 > 1:
			decide on 6;
	if M is latex-intrigued at least 1 or inflation fetish > 0:
		decide on 4;
	if the player is possessing a vagina:
		decide on 4; [To give a chance of labia plumping]
	decide on 2.

If the tier is not applicable for some reason, a random experiment from the
next lower tier is tried.
