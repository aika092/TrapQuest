Chapter 1 Greeting

[A monster has a number called greeted-count.]
A monster has a number called greet-window. [While this is above 0, the NPC has only recently noticed the player so we can credibly say hello without it being vain]

	otherwise:
		now the printed name of talk-greet is the substituted form of "[vanity greeting of M]";
	set next numerical response to the substituted form of "[printed name of T]".

To execute (T - talk-greet) for (M - a monster):

		if M is uninterested, compute defeated perception of M;
		say DefeatedGreetResponse of M;
