[!<YourselfIsSeductive>+

Are you at risk of saying something lewd instead of what you intended?

+!]
Definition: yourself is seductive:

		if T is spank my kitty tattoo, decide yes;
	decide no.


Chapter 1 Greeting


To compute talk option (N - 1) to (M - a monster):
	if times-met is 0, now times-met is 1; [this is a failsafe to make sure the first time greeting never displays twice.]
	let B be a random number from 1 to 4; [variable used so we can refer to bimbo seduce in the next function]
	if the class of the player is cheerleader and a random number between 1 and 2 is 1, now B is 1;
	let seduced be 0;
	if the player is seductive and B is 1 and M is raunchy:
		say "[BimboSeduce of M]";
		now seduced is 1;
		now M is interested; [This is to make sure we pass to the greeting response function]
	otherwise if M is penetrating a fuckhole and M is unfriendly:[Is this monster in the process of dominating the player?]
		say "[ToDominantGreeting of M]";
	otherwise if M is penetrating a fuckhole:[Is this monster acquiring carnal knowledge of the player, with permission?]
		say "[ToPartnerGreeting of M]";
	otherwise if there is a monster penetrating a fuckhole:
		if a random monster penetrating a fuckhole is unfriendly, say "[midDominanceGreeting of M]"; [is the player currently being dominated by another monster?]
		otherwise say "[InSexGreeting of M]"; [is the player currently having consensual sex]
	otherwise if the times-fucked of M > the times-dominated of M:
		say "[SubmissiveGreeting of M]";
	otherwise if the times-dominated of M > the times-fucked of M:
		say "[DominantGreeting of M]";
	otherwise if M is unfriendly:
		say "[UnfriendlyGreeting of M]";
	otherwise if the times-met of M < 2:[This should display the first time the player greets a monster.] 
		say "[FirstGreeting of M]"; [Note that the player has already "met" most monsters at least once if the monster is interested.]
	otherwise:
		say "[RepeatGreeting of M]";[This is the default greeting for most monsters]
	if M is interested:
		if seduced is 0:
			compute greeting response of M;[This is something that should be specific to every monster]
		otherwise:
			say "[BimboSeduced of M]";
	otherwise:
		if M is intelligent, now the boredom of M is 0;
		check perception of M.
		
		
[Submissive and dominant are switched for the monster, since they were on bottom when they got fucked, and on top when they fucked you.]
To compute greeting response of (M - a monster):
	if M is penetrating a fuckhole and M is unfriendly:
		say "[AsDominantResponse of M]";
	otherwise if M is penetrating a fuckhole:

	otherwise if there is a monster penetrating a fuckhole:
		if a random monster penetrating a fuckhole is unfriendly, say "[midDominanceResponse of M]"; [is the player currently being dominated by another monster?]
		otherwise say "[InSexResponse of M]"; [is the player currently having consensual sex]
	otherwise if the times-fucked of M > the times-dominated of M:
		say "[DominantResponse of M]";
	otherwise if the times-dominated of M > the times-fucked of M:
		say "[SubmissiveResponse of M]";[Obviously this doesn't actually have to be "submissive"]
	otherwise if M is unfriendly:
		say "[UnfriendlyResponse of M]";
	otherwise if the times-met of M < 2:
		say "[FirstResponse of M]";
	otherwise:
		say "[RepeatResponse of M]";
	now the boredom of M is 0;
	now M is interested.

[Has the player ever used the fuck skill on this monster? I think that since most fuckable monsters are permanently aggressive once you dominate them, it's fine to have some more forward greetings.]

[This is a greeting for monsters that have previously dominated the player. this is done with sex addiction, but it can easily be switched to straight up bimbo. Note that the "baby daddy" stuff is here, since it should be impossible for a father to have not fucked the player. Unless of course the "father" is the fairy, but we can simply use a custom greeting function instead.]

Chapter 2 Questioning

[Each monster has a value called "question-asked," which tracks the skill question. When the player asks something of a monster, they have a chance to ask the "skill question,".  Questions are otherwise chosen randomly.]
To compute talk option (N - 2) to (M - a monster):
	let I be the intelligence of the player;
	if I < 6, now I is 6;
	let R be a random number between 1 and I;
	let B be a random number from 1 to 4; [this is for bimboseduce. We define the variable so we can use it in the next function.]
	let Q be a random number between 2 and 12;
	if debugmode is 1:
		say "[R] = R. [Q] = Q.";
	if player is seductive and M is raunchy and B is 1:
		now M is interested;
		say "[BimboSeduce of M]";
		say "[BimboSeduced of M]";
	otherwise if R > 4:
		say "[TeachQuestion of M]";
		if the questioned of M > 290 or M is unfriendly or M is uninterested:
			compute annoyance of M;
		otherwise:
			compute teaching of M;
	otherwise:

		otherwise if Q < 10:

		otherwise:
			say "[AdviceQuestion of M]";
		compute answer of M to Q;
	now the question-asked of M is 1.[This is to prevent players from spamming question until they get the outcome they want.]



[questioning npcs will annoy them slightly, but for most you will get 3-4 questions out of them before they tell you to leave them be

BY DEFAULT:

Normal questions increase a value, "questioned" by 100
at 300 questioned, npc's stop giving answers.
when the npc is annoyed, questioned still increases, but at a lowered rate.]

To compute answer of (M - a monster) to (Q - a number):

Chapter 3 Drink Requesting

[Question and greet got attention, so why not this? The idea here is that the player can have a potentially different "wet my throat" for each monster, and each monster has two "avenues" of response. the unfriendly clause should have priority over the uninterested clause.]
