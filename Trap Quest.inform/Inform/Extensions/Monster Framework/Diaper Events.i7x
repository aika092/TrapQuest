Section - Forcefeed

A monster has a number called chosen-forcefeed-round.
[
HERE'S HOW YOU CREATE A FORCEFEED SCENE FOR YOUR NPC:

Simple Version - Just create two functions, with X different possible scenes

To compute forcefeed round (N - a number) of (M - YOUR NPC HERE):
	say "[one of]FEED SCENE 1[or]FEED SCENE 2[or]FEED SCENE X[in random order]";
	StomachFoodUp 1;

To decide which number is the forcefeed-length of (M - YOUR NPC HERE):
	decide on X.

------------------

Complex Version - Create X varied scenes and let the engine choose random ones (always in descending numerical order)

To compute forcefeed round (N - 1) of (M - YOUR NPC HERE):
	say "FEED SCENE 1";
	FEED SCENE 1 EFFECTS;

To compute forcefeed round (N - 2) of (M - YOUR NPC HERE):
	say "FEED SCENE 2";
	FEED SCENE 2 EFFECTS;

To compute forcefeed round (N - X) of (M - YOUR NPC HERE):
	say "FEED SCENE X";
	FEED SCENE X EFFECTS;

To decide which number is the forcefeed-length of (M - YOUR NPC HERE):
	decide on a random number between ??? and ???. [each ??? must be between 1 and X inclusive]

To decide which number is the max-forcefeed-length of (M - YOUR NPC HERE):
	decide on X.

]

To compute forcefeed of (M - a monster):
	if M is not feeding the player:
		compute forcefeed start of M;
	progress the forcefeeding of M;
	let S be the chosen-forcefeed-round of M;
	compute forcefeed round S of M;
	if the sex-length of M <= 0:
		dislodge M;
		say ForcefeedAftermath of M;
		say ForcefeedAfterFlav of M;
		replace any gags;
		satisfy M.

To compute forcefeed start of (M - a monster):
	now the sex-length of M is the forcefeed-length of M;
	now the chosen-forcefeed-round of M is the max-forcefeed-length of M + 1; [because we always subtract at least 1 before the first forcefeed]
	say ForcefeedDeclarationFlav of M;
	follow the monster removing gag rule; [If there's a gag, let's take it off for now]
	now M is grabbing the player;
	now M is feeding the player;
	say ForcefeedStartFlav of M.

To decide which number is the forcefeed-length of (M - a monster):
	decide on 2.

To decide which number is the max-forcefeed-length of (M - a monster): [Set this to however high the NPC's forcefeed rounds go. It shouldn't be less than their forcefeed-length.]
	decide on the forcefeed-length of M.

[
Let's imagine that we are on chosen-forcefeed-round 6 and we have 3 rounds of feeding left.
So we want to decrease chosen-forcefeed-round by at least 1, and no more than 3 (saved in the below function as N), since we need to at the very least be able to go 3 > 2 > 1 in the last 3 rounds of feeding.
Rather than completely random, we choose a random number between 1 and N squared and then apply square root to give us a nice logarithmic probability curve, to make it rarer that we subtract the maximum.

And just for my sanity, let's look at the edge cases to show that nothing super ridiculous should ever happen:
Chosen-forcefeed-round = 2, sex-length = 1; N = 1; S = 1; sex-length is reduced and so then we exit forcefeeding.
Chosen-forcefeed-round = 1, sex-length = 1; N = 0; S = 1; sex-length is reduced and so then we exit forcefeeding.
]
To progress the forcefeeding of (M - a monster):
	let N be the chosen-forcefeed-round of M - the sex-length of M; [This is the maximum we can subtract because we need to have the sex-length of M left over at the end]
	let S be the square root of (a random number between 1 and (N * N));
	decrease the chosen-forcefeed-round of M by S;
	decrease the sex-length of M by 1.

To say ForcefeedDeclarationFlav of (M - a monster):
	say "[speech style of M]'[one of]It looks like it's time for your din-dins!'[or]Babies need to eat and drink to keep up their strength... and to keep their bowels moving.'[in random order][roman type][line break]".

	if the class of the player is catgirl, decide on 1;
	decide on the remainder after dividing time-turns by 2.

To compute forcefeed round (N - a number) of (M - a monster):
	if N is 1 and M is willing to forcefeed pills:
