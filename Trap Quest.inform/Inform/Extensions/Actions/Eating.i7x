		say "[one of]It's really hard to aim the pink pill so it drops through the round opening of your [LipDesc], but you release it and pray for the best. Maybe this will change you back? You hear the pill plonk and bounce around down the plastic tubing of your throat and gullet, sending weird tingles through you from each impact, like there might be some kind of magical effect trying to trigger - or misfire? It bounces and rattles inside your middle section several times, then *plinks* and plops around through your lower tubes, like a ball in a Pachinko parlour, before falling out from between your [AssDesc] and bouncing on the floor. You stand, stunned for several seconds by the humiliation.[or]Once again you force your rubber neck to bend backwards and awkwardly raise your two rubber stumps over your face, trying to judge the angle, and let the pill drop.[line break]It bounces off your lips, and again there's a weird tingly feeling, then the pill rattles around inside you, falling through your tubing, and making the tingle inside intensify... Then plops about from between your [AssDesc] like a tiny rabbit-pellet. You blush![or]As you raise your stumpy doll hands above you, you feel yourself blushing with shame, but you don't let that stop you. You release the pill, hoping that [italic type]this[roman type] time the magic will activate and return you to normal.[line break]Plop![line break]It didn't.[or]Surely the pill will activate sooner or later? You drop it in, it rattles around, then falls to the floor. Again. Rats![stopping]" instead;
