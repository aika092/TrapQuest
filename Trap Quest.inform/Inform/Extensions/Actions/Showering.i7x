Player putting their whole body into the water.

*!]
Showering is an action applying to one thing.

Check showering:
	if the bimbo of the player < 14 and there is a lake monster in the location of the player and auto is 0, say "You don't dare go near with the tentacle monster still lurking in these waters." instead;
	if the player is immobile, say "[if auto is 0]You're a bit immobile at the moment![end if]" instead;
	if the player is flying, say "[if auto is 0]You aren't even touching the ground![end if]" instead;
	if the player is in danger and auto is 0, say "You can't do that in the middle of combat!" instead;
	if the noun is not water-body and the noun is not WoodsScenery01 and the noun is not DungeonScenery03 and the noun is not sacred pool and the noun is not hot-tub, say "[if auto is 0]How would that work exactly?[end if]" instead;
	if there is a worn perceived unmessed diaper and auto is 0:
		say "You feel that it isn't too sensible to get into a body of water when wearing a super-absorbent diaper!  Are you sure you want to? ";
		unless the player is in agreement, say "Action cancelled." instead;
	if the humiliation of the player > 28000 and the semen addiction of the player > 11 and the number of glazed body parts > 0 and watersports fetish is 1 and auto is 0:[We only prevent players from washing themselves if there is another way for them to get clean. i.e. showers of the golden variety rather than normal ones]
		unless there is a lake monster in the location of the player or (there is a worn slimegirl and the hunger of a random slimegirl > 7), say "[second custom style]No way! If I want to get clean, I'll just have someone douse me in [urine]![roman type]" instead.

Report going when the player is in Dungeon35 and newbie tips is 1:
	say "[one of][newbie style]Newbie tip: A body of water!  If [if diaper quest is 1]your clothes have been soiled[otherwise]you have been stained with bodily fluids[end if], you can use this to your advantage. You can clean individual items of clothing with 'clean X in water' and you can use 'wash in water' to go in yourself, and clean everything you're wearing at the same time[if diaper messing >= 4]. You can even use this to clean up after messing yourself[otherwise if diaper lover > 0]. It may be sensible to remove any diapers first though, unless you want them to instantly get fully waterlogged[end if]![roman type][line break][or][stopping]".

	if vagina is not actually occupied and the total felchable volume of vagina > 0:

		if the urine-soak of C > 0:
			increase tracked-semen by 1;
		if the milk-soak of C > 0:
			increase tracked-semen by 1;
		if C is diaper, say "[if C is perceived messed and auto is 0]You use the water to thoroughly clean your [C] and your loins[otherwise]Your diaper is quickly filled to its limit with water. It is now very heavy and won't be able to hold any more liquid[end if].";
		clean C;
		if C is fluid vulnerable, Drench C.
