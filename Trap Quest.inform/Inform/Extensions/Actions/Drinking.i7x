This is the just use your mouth to drink rule:

To say OnlyDrinksSemen:
	say "[second custom style]I won't drink that, [one of]it'll fill up my stomach and then I won't be able to drink as much [AddictedFluids]![or]I am on a strict diet of [AddictedFluids].[cycling][roman type][line break]".

		otherwise:
			say "You're going to have to kneel down if you want to drink that." instead;
	if the noun is not held, do nothing instead; [We need to double check that the player still has the drink. The Drink Me Tattoo, for example, could cause it to have already been consumed during the above 'compute extra turn' function.]
	if autodrink is 0 and the player is overly full and the stomach-water of the player > 2:
		say "You are already feeling very full. Are you sure you want to force even more down (you will have a significantly reduced chance of gaining positive effects)? ";

	say "You tenderly grasp one of the tentacles wrapping around your body and take it into your mouth. It begins to throb excitedly, and the rest of the tentacles tighten and rub against you as well. You begin to forcefully suck on it almost by instinct, and quickly feel it increasing its pace. Your whole body shudders as you feel its orgasm yourself, flooding through you, as thick cords of [semen] pump down your throat. Wrung out by the sensation still echoing through your body, you shiver in delight as it withdraws, spent for the moment.";
