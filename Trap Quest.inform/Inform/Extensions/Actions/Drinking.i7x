You begin to forcefully suck on it almost by instinct, and quickly feel it increasing its pace. Your whole body shudders as you feel its orgasm yourself, flooding through you, as thick cords of [semen] pump down your throat. Wrung out by the sensation still echoing through your body, you shiver in delight as it withdraws, spent for the moment.";
