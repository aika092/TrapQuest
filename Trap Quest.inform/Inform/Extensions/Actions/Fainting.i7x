AutoFainting is an action applying to nothing.

Check AutoFainting:
	if tutorial is 1, say "In the main game, this acts as your safe word to let you always have a way to revoke consent when NPCs are doing naughty things to you. It bails you out of the game no matter what your situation and lets you do a soft reset, in exchange for your most valuable jewellery. However in this tutorial it would break everything, so it is disabled. If you want to revoke consent during the tutorial, please instead type [bold type]'quit'[roman type]." instead.
