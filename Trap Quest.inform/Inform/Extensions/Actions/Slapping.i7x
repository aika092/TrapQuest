REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
To decide which number is the slap damage of (P - a person):
	if backgroundCombatCalculation is false and damage-explained <= 1, decide on saved-slap-damage;
	if damage-explained > 1, say "[input-style]Base slap damage calculation: [bracket]1 (base damage) ";
	let A be 1;
	if thorny tattoo is worn:
		increase A by 1;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "+1 (thorny tattoo) ";
	if wasp sting tattoo is worn:
		increase A by 1;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "+1 (wasp tattoo) ";
	now punch is 0;
	let S be a random worn slap ready equippable;
	if S is equippable:
		let N be the damage improvement of S;
		increase A by N;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "[if N >= 0]+[end if][N] ([ShortDesc of S] bonus) ";
	otherwise:
		if the player is feeling dominant:
			now punch is 1;
			increase A by 1;
			if damage-explained > 1, say "+1 (dominant player clenched fist bonus) ";
	unless there is a worn slap ready projectile equippable:
		increase A by combat bonus;
		if damage-explained > 1, say combat bonus explanation;
	if demon horns is worn and the total-souls of the player > 9:
		increase A by 3;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "+3 (over 9 souls collected) ";
	let L be a random worn living tentacles;
	if L is living tentacles:
		if the charge of L > 50:
			increase A by 3;
			if damage-explained > 1, say "+3 (living tentacles charge > 50) ";
		otherwise if the charge of L > 0:
			increase A by 2;
			if damage-explained > 1, say "+2 (living tentacles charge > 0) ";
		otherwise:
			increase A by 1;
			if damage-explained > 1, say "+1 (living tentacles) ";
	unless there is a worn slap ready projectile equippable:
		if the breastskill of the player is 0:
			let N be the largeness of breasts / 6;
			decrease A by N;
			if damage-explained > 1 and N > 0, say "-[N] (large breasts) ";
		if the player is wrist bound:
			decrease A by 2;
			if damage-explained > 1, say "-2 (wrists bound) ";
		if the weight of the player < 1:
			decrease A by 2;
			if damage-explained > 1, say "-2 (very low weight) ";
		if the player is zeroG:
			if damage-explained > 1, say "[if A * -1 >= 0]+[end if][A * -1] (weightless) ";
			now A is 0;
	decide on A.

Slapping is an action applying to one thing.

[!<CheckSlapping>+

The first portion of the "Slapping" action, which confirms that the player has the ability to slap. If the player is unable to slap, outputs a message explaining why, depending on whether or not the player is attacking manually.

+!]
Check slapping:
	if the noun is container, try MimicInvestigating the noun instead;
	if the noun is lake monster, say "You can't reach it from here." instead;
	if the noun is not monster, say "Err, why would you do that?" instead;
	if the noun is woman-barbara and woman-barbara is not angered:
		say "Are you sure? You probably won't be able to make her friendly ever again, if you were to do that. ";
		unless the player is consenting, say "You change your mind." instead;
	if the player is not able to slap, do nothing instead;
	if the noun is too intimidating, compute surrender to the noun instead.

[!<CarryOutSlapping>+

The second portion of the "Slapping" action, which executes calculates damage based on any slap-compatible equippables.

+!]
Carry out slapping:
	now attack-type is 1;
	reset submitted monsters;
	increase the fat-burning of arms by 20;
	now damage-explained is debuginfo;
	let A be the slap damage of the player;
	if damage-explained > 0, say "[if damage-explained > 1][close bracket] = [A]; [otherwise][input-style]Slap attack: [A][end if][roman type][line break]";
	let S be a random worn slap ready equippable;
	if S is equippable:
		compute attack of S at the noun;
	otherwise:
		let heel-H be 0;
		repeat with H running through worn hindrance-enabling shoes:
			if the hindrance of H > 2:
				now heel-H is 1;
				say "[one of]You are feeling so unstable in your [ShortDesc of H] that you don't dare raise your feet.[or][stopping]";
		say "[if punch is 1][one of]Clenching your fist tight, you[or]You[stopping] punch[otherwise]You slap[end if] [the noun][if heel-H is 1] instead[end if][if the latex-transformation of the player is 8] with your fingerless arms![end if]!  ";
	say "[if the largeness of breasts >= 6 and the breastskill of the player is 0]Your [BreastDesc] are getting in the way and slightly reducing the power of your swing. [otherwise if the largeness of breasts > 12 and the breastskill of the player is 0]Your [BreastDesc] are getting in the way and significantly reducing the power of your swing. [end if][if the player is wrist bound]Unfortunately your wrists being bound significantly hampers the strength you can get into your slaps. [end if][if the player is zeroG]Your body is weightless, meaning you can hardly get any force into your slap without sending yourself flying backwards. [otherwise if the weight of the player < 1]Your body is so light that you don't have the grounding to put your full strength into the slap. [otherwise if fake-nails is worn and fake-nails is blessed and the number of worn slap ready equippables is 1]Your sharp pink nails cause your slap to deal significant extra damage.[otherwise if there is worn living tentacles]The tentacles wrapping around you flail about and strike the enemy as well!  [end if]";
	if there is a worn hostility clothing, compute hostileDamage;
	damage A on the noun.
Understand "slap [something]", "hit [something]", "punch [something]", "slash [something]", "slash at [something]", "swipe [something]", "swipe at [something]", "scratch [something]", "thrust at [something]", "swing at [something]", "sa [something]", "sl [something]", "pu [something]" as slapping.



To decide which number is the zap damage of (P - a person):
	if damage-explained > 1, say "[input-style]Base zap damage calculation: [bracket]0 (base damage) ";
	let A be 0;
	if fire palm tattoo is worn:
		increase A by 1;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "+1 (fire palm tattoo) ";
	if currentZapper is not yourself:
		let N be the damage improvement of currentZapper;
		increase A by N;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "[if N >= 0]+[end if][N] ([ShortDesc of currentZapper] bonus) ";
	decide on A.

Zapping it with is an action applying to two things.

	if the noun is zap ready equippable and the noun is not worn, say "Unfortunately, you can't use that if you're not wielding it!" instead;
	if the noun is not zappable, say "That can't be used to cast spells." instead;
	if the second noun is woman-barbara and woman-barbara is not angered:
		say "Are you sure? You probably won't be able to make her friendly ever again, if you were to do that. ";
		unless the player is consenting, say "You change your mind." instead;
	if the player is not able to zap, do nothing instead;
	if the second noun is too intimidating, compute surrender to the second noun instead.

currentZapper is a thing that varies. currentZapper is yourself.

[!<CarryOutZapping>+

The second portion of the "Zapping" action, which executes calculates damage based on any zap ready equippables.
