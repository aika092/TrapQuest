Check repairing:
	let M be the noun;
	let N be the second noun;
	if the noun is not crotch-ripped clothing and the noun is not top-ripped clothing, say "That doesn't need to be repaired!" instead;
	if the player is not in School09, say "You need to be at a crafting table to do this!" instead;
	if N is not clothing, say "You can't patch clothing with this!" instead;
	if the clothing-material of M is not the clothing-material of N:
		let L be a list of clothing;
		repeat with C running through held clothing:
			if C is not M and the clothing-material of C is the clothing-material of M, add C to L;
		say "You need a [clothing-material of M] item to repair this[if the number of entries in L > 0]. You have [L with definite articles].[otherwise]! You don't have any.[end if]" instead;
	if N is worn, say "You need to take the [N] off first.".
