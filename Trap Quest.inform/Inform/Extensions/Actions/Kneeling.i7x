[!<CarryOutKneeling>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

Carry out kneeling:
	now the stance of the player is 1;
	if seconds > 0 and auto is 0 and the location of the player is unbossed: [It'd be unfair to have the player get serving bondage during a boss fight in my opinion, especially the vine boss]
		let servePunished be 0;
		repeat with X running through carried open topped non-empty vessels:
			let D be the dexterity of the player * (1 + background-waitress);
			let R be a random number between 1 and D;
			if debuginfo > 0, say "[input-style][ShortVesselDesc of X] balance check: dexterity [if background-waitress > 0](doubled from waitress background) [end if]d[D] ([R]) | ([1 + (clumsy * 4)].5) spill evasion difficulty[roman type][line break]";
			if R < (2 + (clumsy * 4)) or there is worn serving-bondage:
				say  "You spill the [printed name of X] on the floor[if the fill-type of X < 20]. What a waste[end if]!";
				Dump X;
				if servePunished is 0 and ((X is waitress vessel and clumsy is 1) or X is probably-serve-ready waitress vessel or (the service-ready of bunny waitress ears is 1 and bunny waitress ears is worn)):
					now servePunished is 1; [So that this only happens once per trip, even with multiple vessels]
					compute service spill punishment;
					say aprilFoolsClumsyFlav;
		if the class of the player is maid and there is a worn spray pink spraybottle and a random number between clumsy and 1 > 0:
			compute a random pink spraybottle breaking;
	let R be a random number between (the bimbo of the player / 2) and the bimbo of the player;
	if there is a dangerous intelligent monster in the location of the player and seconds > 0 and the fatigue of the player > the buckle threshold of the player:
		say "[bold type]You drop to your knees, [if the bimbo of the player < 12]trying not to make eye contact[otherwise]quivering in anticipation[end if].[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise if R < 5:
		say "[bold type]You are now on your knees.[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise if R < 8:
		say "[bold type]You are now on your knees[if a random number between 1 and 6 is 1] once again[end if].[roman type][line break]";
	otherwise if R < 11:
		say "[if a random number between 1 and 6 is 1][line break][variable custom style]I'm on my knees again![otherwise][bold type][line break]You are now on your knees.[end if][roman type][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "[bold type]You are now on your knees,[roman type] like a good little [if diaper quest is 1]baby[otherwise]slut[end if].[line break]";
	if [playerRegion is Mansion and ]the slime-puddle of the location of the player > 0:
		say "[if bukkake fetish is 1]The thick slime on the floor instantly adheres to your skin.[otherwise]The glowing surface of the floor seems to glue itself to your skin.[end if]";
		increase the stickiness of the player by a random number between 4 and 6;
	otherwise if the player is glue stuck:
		let G be a random glue in the location of the player;
		increase the stickiness of the player by a random number between 2 and 3;
	[If the player has a clit lead, a monster will grab it.]
	let N be a random interested unfriendly controlling monster in the location of the player;
	if N is monster and there is a worn subduing clothing:
		compute lead holding of N; [Go to Immobility by Player to see more.]
	[If the player falls over we want to let the other monsters know.]
	if seconds > 0:
		repeat with M running through uninterested monsters in the location of the player:
			if the boredom of M is 0 and M is awake, compute correct perception of M;
	if seconds is 0, allocate 2 seconds;
	otherwise allocate 1 seconds. [seconds = 1 means monsters don't get delayed in "report kneeling when the player is in danger"]


[!<CheckKneelingWhenTheLocationOfThePlayerIsSmoky>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
Check kneeling when the location of the player is smoky:
	if the player is upright and seconds is 0 and auto is 0:
		say "There is [if playerRegion is Mansion]blackish-green[otherwise]pink[end if] smoke in this room, are you sure you want to? ";
		unless the player is in agreement, do nothing instead.


[!<CheckKneelingWhenTheLocationOfThePlayerIsGluePuddled>+

REQUIRES COMMENTING

+!]
Check kneeling when the location of the player is glue-puddled:
	if the player is upright and seconds is 0 and auto is 0:
		say "There is a very sticky-looking puddle of glue covering most of the floor here, are you sure you want to? ";
		if the player is bimbo consenting:
			check glue tripping;
		otherwise:
			do nothing instead.

Understand "kneel", "kneel down", "crawl", "prone", "drop me", "kn" as kneeling.

Report kneeling when the player is in danger and seconds > 1: [This is where we output the reaction of a dominant monster to you conceding a fight before it's over.]
	let N be nothing;
	if there is an intelligent combative monster, now N is a random intelligent combative monster; [We only compute the reaction of one enemy. We prioritise the reaction of intelligent monsters as they probably have a more interesting response.]
	otherwise now N is a random combative monster;
	compute correct kneeling reaction of N;
	if the class of the player is princess, humiliate SLIGHT-HUMILIATION - TRIVIAL-HUMILIATION;
	if newbie tips is 1 and the soreness of asshole > 5 or the soreness of vagina > 5, say "[one of][newbie style]Newbie tip: You could always try 'offer mouth' to avoid your sore holes getting any sorer! Of course, it'll increase humiliation, and there's a chance it won't work.[roman type][line break][or][stopping]";
	repeat with M running through combative monsters:
		if M is human and the health of M >= the maxhealth of M, progress quest of obedience-quest;
		make M expectant. [Here we note that the monster is expectantly waiting to see if the player offers up a particular orifice.]

To compute correct kneeling reaction of (M - a monster):
	if diaper quest is 1, compute DQ kneeling reaction of M;
	otherwise compute kneeling reaction of M.

To compute DQ kneeling reaction of (M - a monster): [Default boring reaction if none is defined.]
	if M is intelligent, say "[BigNameDesc of M] grins.[if the humiliation of the player < HUMILIATION-SHAMELESS - 2000]You shiver with shame.[end if]";
	otherwise say "[BigNameDesc of M] watches you, expressionless.[if the humiliation of the player < HUMILIATION-SHAMELESS - 2000]You shudder with shame.[end if]";
	humiliate MODERATE-HUMILIATION + SLIGHT-HUMILIATION.
