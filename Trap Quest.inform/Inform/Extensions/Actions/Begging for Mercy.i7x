Check begging:
	if the mercyskill of the player is 0 and the class of the player is not cheerleader and the player is not a sissy, say "You don't know this ability. Try [bold type]submit[roman type]ting for now." instead;
	if the player is not monster fucked and the number of monsters grabbing the player is 0:
		if there is a live thing penetrating a body part, try submitting instead;
		say "You are not being fucked, so there is nobody to beg to!" instead;
	if the player is friendly fucked, say "You don't need to beg for mercy, this is consensual sex!" instead;
	unless the player is able to speak:
		if the player is gagged:
			allocate 6 seconds;
			say "You try to beg for mercy, but all that comes out around your [ShortDesc of random thing filling face] is [line break][variable custom style]'Mm mm mmm mmmmph!'[roman type][line break]";
		otherwise if there is a live thing penetrating face:
			let M be a random live thing penetrating face;
			if M is a male intelligent monster:
				allocate 6 seconds;
				say "[variable custom style]'GGHGPHMMN!'[roman type][line break][big he of M] probably didn't understand that.";
			otherwise:
				say "[one of]How are you going to beg? Your mouth is full![or]You can't beg now, your mouth is full, silly![in random order]";
		otherwise if the player is able to trigger manual speech:
			do nothing; [Player has chosen to speak, so we allow it]
		otherwise:
			say "You can't do that while you can't speak." instead;
		now the player-reaction of the player is submitting instead;
	if the player is not able to speak, say "You can't speak right now!" instead.

	if N is nothing, now N is a random monster grabbing the player;
	if the player is not having marital sex, humiliate 50;
