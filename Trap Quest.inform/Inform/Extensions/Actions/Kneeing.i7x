To decide which number is the knee damage of (P - a person):
	if backgroundCombatCalculation is false and damage-explained <= 1, decide on saved-knee-damage;
	if damage-explained > 1, say "[input-style]Base knee damage calculation: [bracket]3 (base damage) ";
	let A be 3;
	increase A by combat bonus;
	if damage-explained > 1, say combat bonus explanation;
	repeat with S running through worn wearthings:
		let N be the knee-modifier of S;
		if N is not 0:
			increase A by N;
			if damage-explained > 1, say "[if N >= 0]+[end if][N] ([ShortDesc of S] bonus) ";
	increase A by permanent-knee-bonus;
	if damage-explained > 1 and permanent-knee-bonus is not 0, say "[if permanent-knee-bonus >= 0]+[end if][permanent-knee-bonus] (imprinted knee bonus) ";
	if the weight of the player < 1:
		decrease A by 2;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "-2 (very low weight) ";
	if demon horns is worn and the total-souls of the player > 9:
		increase A by 3;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "+3 (over 9 souls collected) ";
	if the player is diaper kicking:
		decrease A by 1;
		if damage-explained > 1, say "-1 (diaper penalty) ";
	if the player is zeroG:
		if damage-explained > 1, say "[if A * -1 >= 0]+[end if][A * -1] (weightless) ";
		now A is 0;
	decide on A.

knee-fatigue is a number that varies.
knee-fatigue-delay is a number that varies.

A time based rule (this is the knee fatigue recovery rule):
	if knee-fatigue-delay > 0:
		decrease knee-fatigue-delay by 1;
	otherwise if knee-fatigue > 0:
		decrease knee-fatigue by 1.

permanent-knee-bonus is a number that varies.
