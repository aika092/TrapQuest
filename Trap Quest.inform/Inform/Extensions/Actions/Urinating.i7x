toilet is a backdrop. Understand "urinal", "urinals", "potty", "throne" as toilet. The text-shortcut of a toilet is "toilet". Figure of toilet is the file "Env/MultiFloor/toilet1.png". Figure of human toilet is the file "Env/MultiFloor/toilet2.png". Figure of urinal is the file "Env/MultiFloor/urinal1.png". Figure of throne potty is the file "Env/Dungeon/throne2.png".

To say ExamineDesc of (T - toilet):
	say "A toilet[if watersports mechanics is 1]. You can [bold type]use[roman type] this to relieve yourself[end if].".

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (T - toilet):
	if the player is in the location of ex-princess and ex-princess is caged, decide on examine-image of ex-princess;
	if the player is in Hotel38 and watersports fetish is 1 and diaper quest is 0 and the human-toilet-scene of woman-barbara is not 1, decide on figure of human toilet;
	if the location of the player is urinals and watersports fetish is 1, decide on figure of urinal;
	decide on figure of toilet.

This is the toilet gets focused rule:
	if watersports mechanics is 1 and (the location of the player is urinals or the location of the player is toilets) and the the player is not in Dungeon11 and (ex-princess is not in the location of the player or ex-princess is not caged), focus-consider toilet.
The toilet gets focused rule is listed in the focus finding rules.

To construct normal buttons for (T - toilet):
	if ButtonTableFull is 0 and watersports mechanics is 1 and the player is not incontinent:
		choose a blank row in the Table of Buttons;
		now the ButtonImage entry is Figure of ToiletButton;
		now the ButtonCommand entry is "use toilet";
		now the ButtonColour entry is lightModeFullGreen;
		if the player is prone, now the ButtonColour entry is lightModeFullYellow; [turn yellow - player needs to stand]
	if ButtonTableFull is 0 and the human-toilet-scene of woman-barbara > 1 and there is a held unlock-key and the player is in Hotel38:
		choose a blank row in the Table of Buttons;
		now the ButtonImage entry is the examine-image of a random held unlock-key;
		now the ButtonCommand entry is "unlock toilet";
		now the ButtonColour entry is lightModeFullGreen;
	repeat with E running through held eggs:
		if ButtonTableFull is 0 and the location of the player is toilets:
			choose a blank row in the Table of Buttons;
			now the ButtonImage entry is the examine-image of E;
			now the ButtonCommand entry is "drop [text-shortcut of E]";
			now the ButtonColour entry is lightModeFullGreen;
			if the player is immobile, now the ButtonColour entry is lightModeFullRed.
