Extracting by Actions begins here.


Extracting it with is an action applying to two things. [The second noun is the source of the transfer, and the noun is the destination. "Filling" would be a more appropriate verb but IDGAF]
Check extracting something with:

	if the noun is squirt dildo and the second noun is can, say "The dildo can't fit inside the hole." instead;
	if the player is not able to manually use manual dexterity, do nothing instead;
	if the doses of the second noun is 0, say "But the [ShortDesc of second noun] is empty." instead;
	if the noun is penetrating a fuckhole, say "The [noun] is currently inside you..." instead;
	if the player is not able to manually use manual dexterity, do nothing instead;
	if the doses of the noun > 0:
		say "Are you sure you wish to empty your [noun] of its current contents? ";
		if the player is bimbo consenting:
			say "You empty the contents of the [ShortDesc of the noun] onto the ground.";
			dump the noun;
		otherwise:
			say "You change your mind." instead.

	if the doses of the second noun > the max-doses of the noun:
		DoseFill the noun;
		DoseDown the second noun by the max-doses of the noun;
	otherwise:
		SetDose the noun to the doses of the second noun;
		DoseEmpty the second noun;
	if the fill-colour of the second noun is creamy, compute father material of the second noun into the noun;
