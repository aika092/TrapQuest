Executing Fainting by Fainting begins here.


[!<sexChanged:Integer>*

Set to 1 when the player is sex changed, telling us that the next time the player faints, we should mention it. Then it gets set to 2 so we don't do that again the following time the player faints.

*!]
Sex-changed is a number that varies. Sex-changed is 0.

[!<newlyTattooed:Integer>*

Set to 1 when the player gets a property tattoo as they faint so that we know to mention it.

*!]
Newly-tattooed is a number that varies. Newly-tattooed is 0.

[!<tentacled:Integer>*

This tells us that a tentacle monster saw us faint, and therefore we could get turned into a tentacle breeder potentially.

*!]

tentacled is a number that varies. tentacled is 0.

[!<SetLeftovers>+

We put an object in the room that contains some description about how the player fainted there in the past.

+!]

	repeat with X running through leftovers in the location of the player:

[!<AThingIsImmuneToChange>+

Some things don't get reset when the player faints.

+!]
Definition: A thing (called I) is immune to change:
	if I is worn by the player or I is carried by the player or I is in the location of the player or I is in pink wardrobe or I is in HoleInWall or I is penetrating a body part or I is store clothing or I is in a pedestal, decide yes;
	if I is in School15:
		if I is rare clothing or I is evening dress or I is fetish dress, decide yes;
	decide no.

[!<RecideWhichObjectIsTheBiggestJewel>+

We remove the biggest jewel in the game universe when the player faints, this is how we calculate which jewel is the biggest jewel.

+!]
To decide which object is the biggest jewel:
	let N be 0;
	let bigJ be nothing;
	repeat with J running through in-play plentiful accessories:
		if the price of J > N and J is not in holding pen:
			now N is the price of J;
			now bigJ is J;
	decide on bigJ.

[!<RecideWhichObjectIsTheBiggestHeldJewel>+

Maybe an NPC wants to take away the player's best jewel.

+!]
To decide which object is the biggest held jewel:
	let N be 0;
	let bigJ be nothing;
	repeat with J running through held plentiful accessories:
		if the price of J > N:
			now N is the price of J;
			now bigJ is J;
	decide on bigJ.
