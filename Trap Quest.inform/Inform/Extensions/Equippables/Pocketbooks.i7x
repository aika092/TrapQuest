Section 4 - Notebook

A notebook is a kind of pocketbook. There is 1 notebook. A notebook is usually unique. A notebook is usually slap ready. A notebook is usually leather. The printed name of notebook is usually "[TQlink of item described][clothing-title-before]hands-free notebook[clothing-title-after][TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]".  The text-shortcut of notebook is "hfn". A notebook has a number called tear. A notebook has a number called charge. A notebook is usually intelligence-influencing. A notebook is usually projectile.

A study-buddy is a thing that varies. study-buddy is the throne.

To say ClothingDesc of (W - a notebook):
	say "This hardcover book has your name embroidered on the front, with a blurb on the back that reads 'Paying attention in class? Fooling around with the girls? Showing the boys what you've been learning about in school? This book has your back! Thanks to state of the art magic or whatever, this book takes care of everything completely hands free, just for YOU!' [if the charge of W is 0]The paper is soft, almost damp. It would probably be tough to write on by hand[otherwise if the charge of W < 3]The pages are soft, almost damp. The words on the pages glow faintly, seeming to shift between English and some inscrutable ancient script.[otherwise if the charge of W < 5]The pages are soft, yet crisp, and you can feel warmth and energy when you brush it with your fingertips. The words on the pages glow faintly, shifting unpredictably between English and some inscrutable ancient script[otherwise]The pages are flexible, yet crisp, warm with energy as the glowing words shift rapidly between what appears to be English and some inscrutable ancient script[end if].".

To say ShortDesc of (W - a notebook):
	say "notebook".

[Two ways to empower the notebook:
Crafting. Craft anything while holding the book, which will increase its charge by 1 or  2 depending on your class. Chance of repairing a damaged book.
Sex. Choose a monster and have lots of sex with them, making them your "study buddy," which will empower the book based on times-fucked. Far stronger than crafting, but damages the book the more it's used. ;)]

Check browsing notebook:
	say "You open the book and inspect the intricate runes adorning the pages. You can't understand any of it." instead.
	
To compute studying:
	let G be a random held notebook;
	say "The [printed name of G] falls open, filling its pages with intricate sketches as it siphons off the last of the energy from the bowl. [if the charge of G > 5]It doesn't look any stronger, really.[otherwise]It looks a lot stronger![end if]";	
	increase the charge of G by 1;
	if the number of worn scrunchies is 2, increase the charge of G by 1;
	if the class of the player is schoolgirl and a random number between 1 and 3 is 1:[only the schoolgirl can repair the book.]
		if the tear of G > 0:
			decrease the tear of G by 1;
	if the charge of G > 5 and the class of the player is not schoolgirl, now the charge of G is 5;
	if the charge of G > 10, now the charge of G is 10.

To compute attack of (W - a notebook) at (M - a monster):
	if M is study-buddy and the damage improvement of W > 6:
		say "The [printed name of W] emits pink and red sparks as you thrust your hand at the [M], channelling the energy into a [if the damage improvement of W < 9]huge[otherwise]massive[end if] [if the tear of W < 1][otherwise if the tear of W < 3]fizzling [otherwise if the tear of W < 5]crackling [otherwise]red, crackling [end if][one of]dick[or]penis[at random]-shaped magic missile!";
	otherwise:
		say "The pages of the [printed name of W] glow as you thrust your hand at the [M], channelling the energy into a [if the tear of W < 1][otherwise if the tear of W < 3]fizzling [otherwise if the tear of W < 5]crackling [otherwise]red, crackling [end if] [if the damage improvement of W < 3]arrow-shaped[otherwise if the damage improvement of W < 5]axe-shaped[otherwise]sword-shaped[end if] magic missile!".

To compute attack effect of (W - a notebook):[the effect of tear is going to be the biggest decider here. To utilize the overpowered effect you will have to travel back and forth to the dungeon to repair your book.]
	if attack-type is 1 and the noun is study-buddy:
		let D be a random number between the times-fucked of the noun and (the times-fucked of the noun * 2);[the stronger the attack the higher the risk]
		if W is cursed, increase D by 3;
		unless the class of the player is schoolgirl, increase D by 2;
		if D + (the tear of W * 2) > 20 and the tear of W > 0:
			say "The book emits a sharp crack and sends a whizzing orb of energy careening into your chest. The wind is instantly knocked out of you and you collapse, shivering uncontrollably.";
			FatigueUp 25;
			now the stance of the player is 1;[TODO: remember what effect was supposed to be here]
		otherwise if D > 5 and a random number between 1 and the charge of W + 2 is 1:
			say "[one of]The force of the attack partially singes the pages of the book![or][or][cycling]";
			increase the tear of W by 1;
	now study-buddy is the noun;
	if debugmode > 0, say "Now study buddy is [printed name of study-buddy]".

To decide which number is the damage improvement of (W - a notebook):
	let X be 0;
	increase X by the charge of W;
	if study-buddy is the noun:[This occurs during the "slap X" function so it's ok to use the noun, as well as the best way to apply the buff without modifying your opponent quite a bit]
		increase X by the times-fucked of the noun;
		if W is cursed, now X is X / 2;
	if W is cursed, decrease X by 2;
	if W is blessed, increase X by 1;
	decide on X.

Definition: a notebook (called C) is product:
	decide yes.
	
To decide which number is the alchemy key of (C - a notebook):
	decide on 22.

To decide which number is the crafting key of (C - a notebook):
	decide on 0.

Definition: a notebook (called C) is recipe specific:
	decide yes.

This is the notebook specific recipe rule:
	let R be a random recipe for notebook;
	if R is appropriate:
		now the Product in row 37 of the Table of Alchemy is 22;
		now the Recipe in row 37 of the Table of Alchemy is 1.
The notebook specific recipe rule is listed in the specific recipe rules.

To compute recipe specific cursing of (T - a notebook):
	now T is bland;
	if the noun is not pocketbook, now T is cursed.


Pocketbooks ends here.
