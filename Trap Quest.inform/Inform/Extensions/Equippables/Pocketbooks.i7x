	say "notebook".
To say MediumDesc of (W - a notebook):
	say "hands-free notebook".

Carry out browsing notebook:
	say "You open the book and inspect the intricate runes adorning the pages. You can't understand any of it.".

To compute attack of (W - a notebook) at (M - a monster):
	let I be the damage improvement of W;
	if M is notebook-studied:
		say "The [printed name of W] emits pink and red sparks as you thrust your hand at [NameDesc of M], channelling the energy into a [if I < 3]small[otherwise if I < 6]big[otherwise if I < 9]huge[otherwise]massive[end if], [one of]fizzling[or]crackling[or]sizzling[at random], [one of]dick[or]cock[or]penis[at random]-shaped magic missile!";
	otherwise:
		say "The pages of the [printed name of W] glow as you thrust your hand at [NameDesc of M], channelling the energy into a red, [one of]fizzling[or]crackling[or]sizzling[at random], [if I < 3]arrow-shaped[otherwise if I < 6]axe-shaped[otherwise]sword-shaped[end if] magic missile!".

[You can only study monsters you finish off with the book, or monsters you have sex with more than once.]
To compute studying (N - a number) of (M - a monster):
	let G be a random held notebook;
	let C be 3;
	if the class of the player is schoolgirl, decrease C by the number of worn scrunchies;
	if N is 0:[sex]
		if M is notebook-studied:
			say "A yellow bolt shoots out of the [printed name of G] disappears into [NameDesc of M]'s chest. [big his of M] expression changes slightly, and somehow you know [he of M] looks more favourably on you now.";
			FavourUp M by 1;
		if a random number between 0 and the times-submitted of M < C:
			say "The [printed name of G] shivers, as if a draft were passing through its pages. Looks like it wants to know more about [NameDesc of M]!";
		otherwise:
			say "The [printed name of G] falls open, filling several pages with detailed sketches of [NameDesc of M]'s genitals, which slowly meld with the inscrutable script that covers the rest of its pages. The book seems a lot stronger!";
			now M is notebook-studied;
	otherwise:[kill]
		if M is notebook-studied:
			if a random number between -2 and 4 > C:
				say "The [printed name of G] shivers, and you feel a rush of information moving up your body, straight toward your brain. You feel smarter!";
				IntUp 1;
			otherwise:
				repeat with X running through monsters in the location of the player:
					unless M is dying:
						now the scared of X is the difficulty of M;
						FavourDown X;
				say "The [printed name of G] shivers, emitting a blast of red light that covers everything in the room. [if the number of monsters in the location of the player < 2]It doesn't seem to do anything[otherwise]The [printed name of a random monster in the location of the player] seems affected by it[end if].";
		otherwise:
			say "The [printed name of G] falls open, filling a few with detailed sketches of [NameDesc of M], which slowly meld with the indecipherable script that covers the rest of its pages. The book seems a bit stronger!";
			now M is notebook-studied.


[Considering the player usually has to go three regions to get to the notebook, then run back, the item should be fairly powerful]
To decide which number is the damage improvement of (W - a notebook):
	let X be MagicPowerDamage;
	increase X by (2 + the number of notebook-studied monsters) / 3;
	if the noun is notebook-studied:
		increase X by 2;[if you're having a bad run, this can be a real life saver]
	increase X by the number of worn scrunchies;
	if W is cursed, decrease X by 1;
	if W is blessed, increase X by 1;
	if X < 0, decide on 0;
	decide on X.

Definition: a notebook is product: decide yes.

To decide which number is the alchemy key of (C - a notebook):
	decide on 22.

To decide which number is the crafting key of (C - a notebook):
	decide on 0.

Definition: a notebook is recipe specific: decide yes.

This is the notebook specific recipe rule:
	let R be a random recipe for notebook;
	if R is appropriate:
		now the Product in row 37 of the Table of Alchemy is 22;
		now the Recipe in row 37 of the Table of Alchemy is 1.
The notebook specific recipe rule is listed in the specific recipe rules.

To compute recipe specific cursing of (T - a notebook):
	now T is bland;
	if the noun is not pocketbook, now T is cursed.
