Report taking a giant rattle:
	if the noun is cursed:
		say "Your grip tightens involuntarily as your fingers close around the handle. [variable custom style]I guess the decision's been made for me then, it's my weapon of choice for now...[roman type][line break]";
		now the noun is worn by the player.

Swords ends here.
